* DLS: Dead store of class literal  (DLS_DEAD_STORE_OF_CLASS_LITERAL)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This instruction assigns a class literal to a variable and then never uses it. <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/compatibility.html#literal">The behavior of this differs in Java 1.4 and in Java 5.</a> In Java 1.4 and earlier, a reference to <code>Foo.class</code> would force the static initializer for <code>Foo</code> to be executed, if it has not been executed already.

:See Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/compatibility.html#literal">article on Java SE compatibility for more details and examples, and suggestions on how to force class initialization in Java 5.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it implies useless code.

* TQ: Value that might carry a type qualifier is always used in a way that prohibits it from having that type qualifier  (TQ_MAYBE_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINK)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value that is annotated as possibility being an instance of the values denoted by the type qualifier, and the value is guaranteed to be used in a way that prohibits values denoted by that type qualifier. 

* Avoid Multiple Unary Operators (AvoidMultipleUnaryOperators)
** Category: ANA REL
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The use of multiple unary operators may be problematic, and/or confusing. Ensure that the intended usage is not a bug, or consider simplifying the expression.
:This rule impacts the reliability, since the pattern has a good probability to be a bug. It also impacts analysability, since such unary operators are unnecessarily complex to understand.

* CI: Class is final but declares protected field  (CI_CONFUSED_INHERITANCE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class is declared to be final, but declares fields to be protected. Since the class is final, it can not be derived from, and the use of protected is confusing. The access modifier for the field should be changed to private or public to represent the true use for the field. 

* Unused Local Variable (UnusedLocalVariable)
** Category: ANA EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Detects when a local variable is declared and/or assigned, but not used.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the maintainer will not understand why this variable is declared. It also impacts resources, since there is an unused declared variable.

* ML: Method synchronizes on an updated field  (ML_SYNC_ON_UPDATED_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method synchronizes on an object referenced from a mutable field. This is unlikely to have useful semantics, since different threads may be synchronizing on different objects.

* NP: Possible null pointer dereference on branch that might be infeasible  (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_MIGHT_BE_INFEASIBLE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:There is a branch of statement that, <em>if executed,</em>  guarantees that a null value will be dereferenced, which would generate a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed. Of course, the problem might be that the branch or statement is infeasible and that the null pointer exception can't ever be executed; deciding that is beyond the ability of FindBugs. Due to the fact that this value had been previously tested for nullness, this is a definite possibility. 

* SIC: Could be refactored into a named static inner class  (SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference to the object which created it. This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary. If possible, the class should be made into a <em>static</em> inner class. Since anonymous inner classes cannot be marked as static, doing this will require refactoring the inner class so that it is a named inner class.

* RV: Code checks for specific values returned by compareTo  (RV_CHECK_COMPARETO_FOR_SPECIFIC_RETURN_VALUE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code invoked a compareTo or compare method, and checks to see if the return value is a specific value, such as 1 or -1. When invoking these methods, you should only check the sign of the result, not for any specific non-zero value. While many or most compareTo and compare methods only return -1, 0 or 1, some of them will return other values.

* IMA: Method accesses a private member variable of owning class  (IMA_INEFFICIENT_MEMBER_ACCESS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method of an inner class reads from or writes to a private member variable of the owning class, or calls a private method of the owning class. The compiler must generate a special method to access this private member, causing this to be less efficient. Relaxing the protection of the member variable or method will allow the compiler to treat this as a normal access. 

* Broken NullCheck (BrokenNullCheck)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:The null check is broken since it will throw a NullPointerException itself. It is likely that you used || instead of && or vice versa.
:This pattern impacts the reliability, since an exception may be thrown.

* FL: Method performs math using floating point precision  (FL_MATH_USING_FLOAT_PRECISION)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:The method performs math operations using floating point precision. Floating point precision is very imprecise. For example, 16777216.0f + 1.0f = 16777216.0f. Consider using double math instead.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* Nm: Very confusing method names (but perhaps intentional) (NM_VERY_CONFUSING_INTENTIONAL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization. This is very confusing because if the capitalization were identical then one of the methods would override the other. From the existence of other methods, it seems that the existence of both of these methods is intentional, but is sure is confusing. You should try hard to eliminate one of them, unless you are forced to have both due to frozen APIs. 

* Se: Class is Serializable but its superclass doesn't define a void constructor  (SE_NO_SUITABLE_CONSTRUCTOR)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This class implements the <code>Serializable</code> interface and its superclass does not. When such an object is deserialized, the fields of the superclass need to be initialized by invoking the void constructor of the superclass. Since the superclass does not have one, serialization and deserialization will fail at runtime.
:This rule impacts reliability, since an exception will be thrown at runtime when deserialising the object.

* Empty Statement Not In Loop (EmptyStatementNotInLoop)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:An empty statement (or a semicolon by itself) that is not used as the sole body of a 'for' or 'while' loop is probably a bug. It could also be a double semicolon, which has no purpose and should be removed.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.

* Dm: Use the nextInt method of Random rather than nextDouble to generate a random integer  (DM_NEXTINT_VIA_NEXTDOUBLE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:If <code>r</code> is a <code>java.util.Random</code>, you can generate a random number from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code> using <code>r.nextInt(n)</code>, rather than using <code>(int)(r.nextDouble() * n)</code>. 
:The argument to nextInt must be positive. If, for example, you want to generate a random value from -99 to 0, use <code>-r.nextInt(100)</code>.

* UG: Unsynchronized get method, synchronized set method  (UG_SYNC_SET_UNSYNC_GET)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class contains similarly-named get and set methods where the set method is synchronized and the get method is not. This may result in incorrect behavior at runtime, as callers of the get method will not necessarily see a consistent state for the object. The get method should be made synchronized.

* Eq: equals() method defined that doesn't override Object.equals(Object) (EQ_OTHER_USE_OBJECT)
** Category: COR REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This class defines an <code>equals()</code> method, that doesn't override the normal <code>equals(Object)</code> method defined in the base <code>java.lang.Object</code> class. The class should probably define a <code>boolean equals(Object)</code> method. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will be confused by this method's name.

* RV: Exception created and dropped rather than thrown (RV_EXCEPTION_NOT_THROWN)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code creates an exception (or error) object, but doesn't do anything with it. For example, something like <pre>if (x < 0) new IllegalArgumentException("x must be nonnegative");</code>. It was probably the intent of the programmer to throw the created exception:<code>if (x < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("x must be nonnegative");</code>.

* BIT: Incompatible bit masks  (BIT_AND)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This method compares an expression of the form (e &amp; C) to D, which will always compare unequal due to the specific values of constants C and D. This may indicate a logic error or typo.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is probably not what was intended.

* UseUtilityClass (UseUtilityClass)
** Category: REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:For classes that only have static methods, consider making them utility classes. Note that this doesn't apply to abstract classes, since their subclasses may well include non-static methods. Also, if you want this class to be a utility class, remember to add a private constructor to prevent instantiation. (Note, that this use was known before PMD 5.1.0 as UseSingleton).
:This rule impacts reusability, since making the class a utility would ease its access and usage.

* MS: Field should be both final and package protected  (MS_FINAL_PKGPROTECT)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A mutable static field could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. The field could be made package protected and/or made final to avoid this vulnerability.

* Simplify Boolean Returns (SimplifyBooleanReturns)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid unnecessary if-then-else statements when returning a boolean. The result of the conditional test can be returned instead.
:This rule impacts analysability, since unnecessary code confuses the reader.

* No: Using notify() rather than notifyAll() (NO_NOTIFY_NOT_NOTIFYALL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method calls <code>notify()</code> rather than <code>notifyAll()</code>. Java monitors are often used for multiple conditions. Calling <code>notify()</code> only wakes up one thread, meaning that the thread woken up might not be the one waiting for the condition that the caller just satisfied.

* Missing Static Method In Non Instantiatable Class (MissingStaticMethodInNonInstantiatableClass)
** Category: EFF ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A class that has private constructors and does not have any static methods or fields cannot be used.
:This rule impacts analysability, since an unusable class represents unnecessary code. It also impact resources for the memory unnecessarily used.

* SA: Self assignment of local rather than assignment to field  (SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT_INSTEAD_OF_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a self assignment of a local variable, and there is a field with an identical name. assignment appears to have been ; e.g. <pre>public void setFoo(int foo) { foo = foo; }</pre>. The assignment is useless. Did you mean to assign to the field instead?

* STI: Unneeded use of currentThread() call, to call interrupted()  (STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_CURRENTTHREAD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method invokes the <code>Thread.currentThread()</code> call, just to call the <code>interrupted()</code> method. As <code>interrupted()</code> is a static method, it is more simple and clear to use <code>Thread.interrupted()</code>. 

* REC: Exception is caught when Exception is not thrown  (REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method uses a try-catch block that catches Exception objects, but Exception is not thrown within the try block, and RuntimeException is not explicitly caught.  It is a common bug pattern to say try { ... } catch (Exception e) { something } as a shorthand for catching a number of types of exception each of whose catch blocks is identical, but this construct also accidentally catches RuntimeException as well, masking potential bugs. 
:A better approach is to either explicitly catch the specific exceptions that are thrown, or to explicitly catch RuntimeException exception, rethrow it, and then catch all non-Runtime Exceptions, as shown below: <pre> try { ... } catch (RuntimeException e) { throw e; } catch (Exception e) { ... deal with all non-runtime exceptions ... }</pre>

* DP: Method invoked that should be only be invoked inside a doPrivileged block  (DP_DO_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This code invokes a method that requires a security permission check. If this code will be granted security permissions, but might be invoked by code that does not have security permissions, then the invocation needs to occur inside a doPrivileged block.

* DL: Synchronization on boxed primitive values  (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_UNSHARED_BOXED_PRIMITIVE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code synchronizes on an apparently unshared boxed primitive, such as an Integer.
:<pre>private static final Integer fileLock = new Integer(1); ... synchronized(fileLock) { .. do something .. } ... </pre>
:It would be much better, in this code, to redeclare fileLock as <code>private static final Object fileLock = new Object();</code>. The existing code might be OK, but it is confusing and a future refactoring, such as the "Remove Boxing" refactoring in IntelliJ, might replace this with the use of an interned Integer object shared throughout the JVM, leading to very confusing behavior and potential deadlock.

* UW: Unconditional wait  (UW_UNCOND_WAIT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a call to <code>java.lang.Object.wait()</code> which is not guarded by conditional control flow. The code should verify that condition it intends to wait for is not already satisfied before calling wait; any previous notifications will be ignored. 

* NP: Load of known null value  (NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The variable referenced at this point is known to be null due to an earlier check against null. Although this is valid, it might be a mistake (perhaps you intended to refer to a different variable, or perhaps the earlier check to see if the variable is null should have been a check to see if it was nonnull). 

* Se: Serializable inner class  (SE_INNER_CLASS)
** Category: EFF
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This Serializable class is an inner class.  Any attempt to serialize it will also serialize the associated outer instance. The outer instance is serializable, so this won't fail, but it might serialize a lot more data than intended. If possible, making the inner class a static inner class (also known as a nested class) should solve the problem.
:This rule impacts efficiency, since a lot more data may be serialised than needed. It may produce false positive since we don't know how much data is really needed in the serialisation.

* RC: Suspicious reference comparison  (RC_REF_COMPARISON)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method compares two reference values using the == or != operator, where the correct way to compare instances of this type is generally with the equals() method. It is possible to create distinct instances that are equal but do not compare as == since they are different objects. Examples of classes which should generally not be compared by reference are java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Float, etc.

* UuF: Unused public or protected field  (UUF_UNUSED_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This field is never used. The field is public or protected, so perhaps it is intended to be used with classes not seen as part of the analysis. If not, consider removing it from the class.

* SIC: Should be a static inner class  (SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference to the object which created it. This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary. If possible, the class should be made static. 

* JCIP: Fields of immutable classes should be final  (JCIP_FIELD_ISNT_FINAL_IN_IMMUTABLE_CLASS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The class is annotated with net.jcip.annotations.Immutable or javax.annotation.concurrent.Immutable, and the rules for those annotations require that all fields are final.

* DL: Synchronization on boxed primitive  (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOXED_PRIMITIVE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Integer.</p> <pre> private static Integer count = 0; ... synchronized(count) { count++; } ... </pre> Since Integer objects can be cached and shared, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock.
:See CERT <a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/CON08-J.+Do+not+synchronize+on+objects+that+may+be+reused">CON08-J. Do not synchronize on objects that may be reused</a> for more information.

* IL: An apparent infinite recursive loop  (IL_INFINITE_RECURSIVE_LOOP)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method unconditionally invokes itself. This would seem to indicate an infinite recursive loop that will result in a stack overflow.

* UR: Uninitialized read of field in constructor  (UR_UNINIT_READ)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This constructor reads a field which has not yet been assigned a value. This is often caused when the programmer mistakenly uses the field instead of one of the constructor's parameters.

* EC: Invocation of equals() on an array, which is equivalent to == (EC_BAD_ARRAY_COMPARE)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This method invokes the .equals(Object o) method on an array. Since arrays do not override the equals method of Object, calling equals on an array is the same as comparing their addresses. To compare the contents of the arrays, use <code>java.util.Arrays.equals(Object[], Object[])</code>. To compare the addresses of the arrays, it would be less confusing to explicitly check pointer equality using <code>==</code>. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it is easier to read and understand the pointer equality for the intended behaviour.

* LI: Incorrect lazy initialization of static field  (LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a non-volatile static field. Because the compiler or processor may reorder instructions, threads are not guaranteed to see a completely initialized object, <em>if the method can be called by multiple threads</em>. You can make the field volatile to correct the problem. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/">Java Memory Model web site</a>. 

* Unconditional If Statement (UnconditionalIfStatement)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid returning from a finally block, this can discard exceptions.
:A maintainer will have trouble understanding why an unconditional if has been used. It further clutters the code.

* FS: Format string references missing argument  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_MISSING_ARGUMENT)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 1
** Description:
:Not enough arguments are passed to satisfy a placeholder in the format string. A runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since the pattern will throw an exception when executed.

* Eq: equals method overrides equals in superclass and may not be symmetric  (EQ_OVERRIDING_EQUALS_NOT_SYMMETRIC)
** Category: COR REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This class defines an equals method that overrides an equals method in a superclass. Both equals methods use <code>instanceof</code> in the determination of whether two objects are equal. This is fraught with peril, since it is important that the equals method is symmetrical (in other words, <code>a.equals(b) == b.equals(a)</code>). If B is a subtype of A, and A's equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof A, and B's equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof B, it is quite likely that the equivalence relation defined by these methods is not symmetric. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will assume the method is symmetric.

* Empty Switch Statements (EmptySwitchStatements)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Empty switch statements serve no purpose and should be removed.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.

* Empty Finally Block (EmptyFinallyBlock)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Empty finally blocks serve no purpose and should be removed.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.

* DL: Synchronization on Boolean  (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOOLEAN)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Boolean.</p> <pre> private static Boolean inited = Boolean.FALSE; ... synchronized(inited) { if (!inited) { init(); inited = Boolean.TRUE; } } ... </pre> Since there normally exist only two Boolean objects, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock.
:See CERT <a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/CON08-J.+Do+not+synchronize+on+objects+that+may+be+reused">CON08-J. Do not synchronize on objects that may be reused</a> for more information.

* Use Collection isEmpty (UseCollectionIsEmpty)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The isEmpty() method on java.util.Collection is provided to determine if a collection has any elements. Comparing the value of size() to 0 does not convey intent as well as the isEmpty() method.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the intent is much clearer for the maintainer.

* FI: Explicit invocation of finalizer  (FI_EXPLICIT_INVOCATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains an explicit invocation of the <code>finalize()</code> method on an object. Because finalizer methods are supposed to be executed once, and only by the VM, this is a bad idea.
:If a connected set of objects beings finalizable, then the VM will invoke the finalize method on all the finalizable object, possibly at the same time in different threads. Thus, it is a particularly bad idea, in the finalize method for a class X, invoke finalize on objects referenced by X, because they may already be getting finalized in a separate thread. 

* RV: Negating the result of compareTo()/compare() (RV_NEGATING_RESULT_OF_COMPARETO)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This code negatives the return value of a compareTo or compare method. This is a questionable or bad programming practice, since if the return value is Integer.MIN_VALUE, negating the return value won't negate the sign of the result. You can achieve the same intended result by reversing the order of the operands rather than by negating the results. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since it may produce unpredictable behavirour in some cases.

* UuF: Unused field (UUF_UNUSED_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This field is never used. Consider removing it from the class.

* LawOfDemeter (LawOfDemeter)
** Category: REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The Law of Demeter is a simple rule, that says 'only talk to friends'. It helps to reduce coupling between classes or objects. See also the references: Andrew Hunt, David Thomas, and Ward Cunningham. The Pragmatic Programmer. From Journeyman to Master. Addison-Wesley Longman, Amsterdam, October 1999.; K.J.

:This rule can detect possible violations of the Law of Demeter. The Law of Demeter is a simple rule, that says 'only talk to friends'. It helps to reduce coupling between classes or objects.
:This rule impacts reusability, since many classes need to be available for this class to work.

* DLS: Useless increment in return statement (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_INCREMENT_IN_RETURN)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This statement has a return such as <code>return x++;</code>. A postfix increment/decrement does not impact the value of the expression, so this increment/decrement has no effect. Please verify that this statement does the right thing.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since a maintainer will wonder why the increment has been added if not used.

* BAC: Bad Applet Constructor relies on uninitialized AppletStub  (BAC_BAD_APPLET_CONSTRUCTOR)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This constructor calls methods in the parent Applet that rely on the AppletStub. Since the AppletStub isn't initialized until the init() method of this applet is called, these methods will not perform correctly. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the pattern executes uninitialised code.

* Avoid Using Octal Values (AvoidUsingOctalValues)
** Category: REL ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Integer literals should not start with zero since this denotes that the rest of literal will be interpreted as an octal value.
:This rule impacts reliability, since the number specified may not be the one intended. It also impacts analysability, since the maintainer will have trouble deciding if the value is a decimal or octal value.

* Bx: Method invokes inefficient floating-point Number constructor; use static valueOf instead  (DM_FP_NUMBER_CTOR)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Using <code>new Double(double)</code> is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas <code>Double.valueOf(double)</code> allows caching of values to be done by the compiler, class library, or JVM. Using of cached values avoids object allocation and the code will be faster. 
:Values between -128 and 127 are guaranteed to have corresponding cached instances and using <code>valueOf</code> is approximately 3.5 times faster than using constructor. For values outside the constant range the performance of both styles is the same.
:Unless the class must be compatible with JVMs predating Java 1.5, use either autoboxing or the <code>valueOf()</code> method when creating instances of <code>Long</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Short</code>, <code>Character</code>, and <code>Byte</code>.

* Confusing Ternary (ConfusingTernary)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid negation within an 'if' expression with an 'else' clause. For example, rephrase: if (x != y) diff(); else same(); as: if (x == y) same(); else diff(); Most 'if (x != y)' cases without an 'else' are often return cases, so consistent use of this rule makes the code easier to read. Also, this resolves trivial ordering problems, such as 'does the error case go first?' or 'does the common case go first?'.
:This rule impacts analysability.

* Loose Package Coupling (LoosePackageCoupling)
** Category: REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid using classes from the configured package hierarchy outside of the package hierarchy, except when using one of the configured allowed classes.
:The loose package coupling Rule can be used to ensure coupling outside of a package hierarchy is minimized to all but an allowed set of classes from within the package hierarchy. For example, supposed you have the following package hierarchy: org.sample, org.sample.impl, org.sample.util, and the allowed class org.sample.SampleInterface. This rule can be used to ensure that all classes within the org.sample package and its sub-packages are not used outside of the org.sample package hierarchy. Further, the only allowed usage outside of a class in the org.sample hierarchy would be via org.sample.SampleInterface.
:TODO: doesn't work without configuring the allowed classes.
:This rule impacts reusability, since many packages need to be available for this class to work.

* Override Both Equals And Hash code (OverrideBothEqualsAndHashcode)
** Category: CHA REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Override both public boolean Object.equals(Object other), and public int Object.hashCode(), or override neither. Even if you are inheriting a hashCode() from a parent class, consider implementing hashCode and explicitly delegating to your superclass. 
:Even if at some time only one of these methods is indeed used, a maintainer will assume that the code is consistent, i.e. the hashCode and equals functions are both overriden to fit the new behaviour.

* Class With Only Private Constructors Should Be Final (ClassWithOnlyPrivateConstructorsShouldBeFinal)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A class with only private constructors should be final, unless the private constructor is invoked by a inner class.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the maintainer will have trouble understanding the intent of the class.

* AM: Creates an empty jar file entry  (AM_CREATES_EMPTY_JAR_FILE_ENTRY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code calls <code>putNextEntry()</code>, immediately followed by a call to <code>closeEntry()</code>. This results in an empty JarFile entry. The contents of the entry should be written to the JarFile between the calls to <code>putNextEntry()</code> and <code>closeEntry()</code>.

* RpC: Repeated conditional tests  (RpC_REPEATED_CONDITIONAL_TEST)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code contains a conditional test is performed twice, one right after the other (e.g., <code>x == 0 || x == 0</code>). Perhaps the second occurrence is intended to be something else (e.g., <code>x == 0 || y == 0</code>). 

* Wa: Wait not in loop   (WA_NOT_IN_LOOP)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a call to <code>java.lang.Object.wait()</code> which is not in a loop. If the monitor is used for multiple conditions, the condition the caller intended to wait for might not be the one that actually occurred.

* NP: Read of unwritten public or protected field  (NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The program is dereferencing a public or protected field that does not seem to ever have a non-null value written to it. Unless the field is initialized via some mechanism not seen by the analysis, dereferencing this value will generate a null pointer exception. 

* Bx: Primitive value is boxed and then immediately unboxed (BX_BOXING_IMMEDIATELY_UNBOXED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A primitive is boxed, and then immediately unboxed. This probably is due to a manual boxing in a place where an unboxed value is required, thus forcing the compiler to immediately undo the work of the boxing. 

* Eq: Covariant equals() method defined for enum (EQ_DONT_DEFINE_EQUALS_FOR_ENUM)
** Category: COR REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This class defines an enumeration, and equality on enumerations are defined using object identity. Defining a covariant equals method for an enumeration value is exceptionally bad practice, since it would likely result in having two different enumeration values that compare as equals using the covariant enum method, and as not equal when compared normally. Don't do it. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will assume equals methods are consistent.

* HE: Class defines hashCode() but not equals() (HE_HASHCODE_NO_EQUALS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a <code>hashCode()</code> method but not an <code>equals()</code> method. Therefore, the class may violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.

* Abstract Class Without Any Method (AbstractClassWithoutAnyMethod)
** Category: CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:If an abstract class does not provides any methods, it may be acting as a simple data container that is not meant to be instantiated. In this case, it is probably better to use a private or protected constructor in order to prevent instantiation than make the class misleadingly abstract.
:This rule impacts changeability, since the intent of the class is made much clearer for the maintainer.

* MSF: Mutable servlet field  (MSF_MUTABLE_SERVLET_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A web server generally only creates one instance of servlet or jsp class (i.e., treats the class as a Singleton), and will have multiple threads invoke methods on that instance to service multiple simultaneous requests. Thus, having a mutable instance field generally creates race conditions.

* IC: Initialization circularity  (IC_INIT_CIRCULARITY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A circularity was detected in the static initializers of the two classes referenced by the bug instance. Many kinds of unexpected behavior may arise from such circularity.

* Dm: Monitor wait() called on Condition (DM_MONITOR_WAIT_ON_CONDITION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method calls <code>wait()</code> on a <code>java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition</code> object. Waiting for a <code>Condition</code> should be done using one of the <code>await()</code> methods defined by the <code>Condition</code> interface. 

* STCAL: Call to static DateFormat  (STCAL_INVOKE_ON_STATIC_DATE_FORMAT_INSTANCE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:As the JavaDoc states, DateFormats are inherently unsafe for multithreaded use. The detector has found a call to an instance of DateFormat that has been obtained via a static field. This looks suspicous.
:For more information on this see <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6231579">Sun Bug #6231579</a> and <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6178997">Sun Bug #6178997</a>.

* GC: No relationship between generic parameter and method argument  (GC_UNRELATED_TYPES)
** Category: COR CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This call to a generic collection method contains an argument with an incompatible class from that of the collection's parameter (i.e., the type of the argument is neither a supertype nor a subtype of the corresponding generic type argument). Therefore, it is unlikely that the collection contains any objects that are equal to the method argument used here. Most likely, the wrong value is being passed to the method.
:In general, instances of two unrelated classes are not equal. For example, if the Foo and Bar classes are not related by subtyping, then an instance of Foo should not be equal to an instance of Bar. Among other issues, doing so will likely result in an equals method that is not symmetrical. For example, if you define the Foo class so that a Foo can be equal to a String, your equals method isn't symmetrical since a String can only be equal to a String.
:In rare cases, people do define nonsymmetrical equals methods and still manage to make their code work. Although none of the APIs document or guarantee it, it is typically the case that if you check if a Collection<String> contains a Foo, the equals method of argument (e.g., the equals method of the Foo class) used to perform the equality checks.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts changeability, since a maintainer will wonder why these parameters are used.

* EI2: May expose internal representation by incorporating reference to mutable object  (EI_EXPOSE_REP2)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into the internal representation of the object. If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do something different. Storing a copy of the object is better approach in many situations.

* Nm: Use of member identifier that is a keyword in later versions of Java  (NM_FUTURE_KEYWORD_USED_AS_MEMBER_IDENTIFIER)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This identifier is used as a keyword in later versions of Java. This code, and any code that references this API, will need to be changed in order to compile it in later versions of Java.

* Simple Date Format Needs Locale (SimpleDateFormatNeedsLocale)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Be sure to specify a Locale when creating SimpleDateFormat instances to ensure that locale-appropriate formatting is used.
:This rule impacts reliability, since it may produce an unpredictable behaviour for different locales.

* IMSE: Dubious catching of IllegalMonitorStateException  (IMSE_DONT_CATCH_IMSE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:IllegalMonitorStateException is generally only thrown in case of a design flaw in your code (calling wait or notify on an object you do not hold a lock on).

* DLS: Dead store of null to local variable  (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_OF_NULL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code stores null into a local variable, and the stored value is not read. This store may have been introduced to assist the garbage collector, but as of Java SE 6.0, this is no longer needed or useful. 

* BC: Impossible downcast  (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST)
** Category: COR REL
** Priority: 1
** Description:
:This cast will always throw a ClassCastException. The analysis believes it knows the precise type of the value being cast, and the attempt to downcast it to a subtype will always fail by throwing a ClassCastException. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since an exception will be thrown. It also impacts correctness, since invariably throwing an exception was probably not what was intended.

* SWL: Method calls Thread.sleep() with a lock held (SWL_SLEEP_WITH_LOCK_HELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method calls Thread.sleep() with a lock held.  This may result in very poor performance and scalability, or a deadlock, since other threads may be waiting to acquire the lock.  It is a much better idea to call wait() on the lock, which releases the lock and allows other threads to run. 

* TLW: Wait with two locks held  (TLW_TWO_LOCK_WAIT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Waiting on a monitor while two locks are held may cause deadlock. Performing a wait only releases the lock on the object being waited on, not any other locks. This not necessarily a bug, but is worth examining closely.

* Eq: Class defines compareTo(...) and uses Object.equals() (EQ_COMPARETO_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a <code>compareTo(...)</code> method but inherits its <code>equals()</code> method from <code>java.lang.Object</code>. Generally, the value of compareTo should return zero if and only if equals returns true. If this is violated, weird and unpredictable failures will occur in classes such as PriorityQueue. In Java 5 the PriorityQueue.remove method uses the compareTo method, while in Java 6 it uses the equals method.
:From the JavaDoc for the compareTo method in the Comparable interface: <blockquote> It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that <code>(x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y))</code>. Generally speaking, any class that implements the Comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact. The recommended language is 'Note: this class has a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals'.</blockquote>

* ITA: Method uses toArray() with zero-length array argument (ITA_INEFFICIENT_TO_ARRAY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method uses the toArray() method of a collection derived class, and passes in a zero-length prototype array argument.  It is more efficient to use <code>myCollection.toArray(new Foo[myCollection.size()])</code> If the array passed in is big enough to store all of the elements of the collection, then it is populated and returned directly. This avoids the need to create a second array (by reflection) to return as the result.

* Bx: Primitive value is boxed then unboxed to perform primitive coercion  (BX_BOXING_IMMEDIATELY_UNBOXED_TO_PERFORM_COERCION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A primitive boxed value constructed and then immediately converted into a different primitive type (e.g., <code>new Double(d).intValue()</code>). Just perform direct primitive coercion (e.g., <code>(int) d</code>).

* UCF: Useless control flow  (UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a useless control flow statement, where control flow continues onto the same place regardless of whether or not the branch is taken. For example, this is caused by having an empty statement block for an <code>if</code> statement: <pre>if (argv.length == 0) { /* TODO: handle this case */ }</pre>

* FB: Unexpected/undesired warning from FindBugs  (FB_UNEXPECTED_WARNING)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 5
** Description:
:FindBugs generated a warning that, according to a @NoWarning annotated, is unexpected or undesired
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* SIO: Unnecessary type check done using instanceof operator  (SIO_SUPERFLUOUS_INSTANCEOF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Type check performed using the instanceof operator where it can be statically determined whether the object is of the type requested. 

* AT: Sequence of calls to concurrent abstraction may not be atomic  (AT_OPERATION_SEQUENCE_ON_CONCURRENT_ABSTRACTION)
** Category: COR THR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This code contains a sequence of calls to a concurrent abstraction (such as a concurrent hash map). These calls will not be executed atomically.

* Non Thread Safe Singleton (NonThreadSafeSingleton)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Non-thread safe singletons can result in bad state changes. Eliminate static singletons if possible by instantiating the object directly. Static singletons are usually not needed as only a single instance exists anyway. Other possible fixes are to synchronize the entire method or to use an initialize-on-demand holder class (do not use the double-check idiom). See Effective Java, item 48.
:This rule impacts reliability, since bad state changes may induce an unpredictable behaviour.

* Empty Try Block (EmptyTryBlock)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid empty try blocks - there do nothing and just clutter the code.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it introduces unnecessary code.

* RV: Return value of putIfAbsent ignored, value passed to putIfAbsent reused  (RV_RETURN_VALUE_OF_PUTIFABSENT_IGNORED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The <code>putIfAbsent</code> method is typically used to ensure that a single value is associated with a given key (the first value for which put if absent succeeds). If you ignore the return value and retain a reference to the value passed in, you run the risk of retaining a value that is not the one that is associated with the key in the map. If it matters which one you use and you use the one that isn't stored in the map, your program will behave incorrectly.

* Dm: Hardcoded constant database password  (DMI_CONSTANT_DB_PASSWORD)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 1
** Description:
:This code creates a database connect using a hardcoded, constant password. Anyone with access to either the source code or the compiled code can easily learn the password. 

* SA: Nonsensical self computation involving a field  (SA_FIELD_SELF_COMPUTATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method performs a nonsensical computation of a field with another reference to the same field (e.g., x&amp;x or x-x). Because of the nature of the computation, this operation doesn't seem to make sense, and may indicate a typo or a logic error.  Double check the computation. 

* INT: Bad comparison of nonnegative value with negative constant  (INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_NONNEGATIVE_VALUE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code compares a value that is guaranteed to be non-negative with a negative constant. 

* IA: Potentially ambiguous invocation of either an inherited or outer method  (IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:An inner class is invoking a method that could be resolved to either a inherited method or a method defined in an outer class. For example, you invoke <code>foo(17)</code>, which is defined in both a superclass and in an outer method. By the Java semantics, it will be resolved to invoke the inherited method, but this may not be want you intend. 
:If you really intend to invoke the inherited method, invoke it by invoking the method on super (e.g., invoke super.foo(17)), and thus it will be clear to other readers of your code and to FindBugs that you want to invoke the inherited method, not the method in the outer class.
:If you call <code>this.foo(17)</code>, then the inherited method will be invoked. However, since FindBugs only looks at classfiles, it can't tell the difference between an invocation of <code>this.foo(17)</code> and <code>foo(17)</code>, it will still complain about a potential ambiguous invocation.

* RV: Method checks to see if result of String.indexOf is positive  (RV_CHECK_FOR_POSITIVE_INDEXOF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The method invokes String.indexOf and checks to see if the result is positive or non-positive. It is much more typical to check to see if the result is negative or non-negative. It is positive only if the substring checked for occurs at some place other than at the beginning of the String.

* ODR: Method may fail to close database resource  (ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The method creates a database resource (such as a database connection or row set), does not assign it to any fields, pass it to other methods, or return it, and does not appear to close the object on all paths out of the method. Failure to close database resources on all paths out of a method may result in poor performance, and could cause the application to have problems communicating with the database. 

* Constructor Calls Overridable Method (ConstructorCallsOverridableMethod)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Calling overridable methods during construction poses a risk of invoking methods on an incompletely constructed object and can be difficult to debug. It may leave the sub-class unable to construct its superclass or forced to replicate the construction process completely within itself, losing the ability to call super(). If the default constructor contains a call to an overridable method, the subclass may be completely uninstantiable. Note that this includes method calls throughout the control flow graph - i.e., if a constructor Foo() calls a private method bar() that calls a public method buz(), this denotes a problem.
:Searches through all methods and constructors called from constructors. It marks as dangerous any call to overridable methods from non-private constructors. It marks as dangerous any calls to dangerous private constructors from non-private constructors.
:This rule impacts reliability, since the object may not be fully initialised. It may throw exceptions or cause an unpredictable behaviour.

* SW: Certain swing methods needs to be invoked in Swing thread  (SW_SWING_METHODS_INVOKED_IN_SWING_THREAD)
** Category: COR THR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090526170426/">Web archive</a><a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/JDCTechTips/2003/tt1208.html">From JDC Tech Tip</a>): The Swing methods show(), setVisible(), and pack() will create the associated peer for the frame. With the creation of the peer, the system creates the event dispatch thread. This makes things problematic because the event dispatch thread could be notifying listeners while pack and validate are still processing. This situation could result in two threads going through the Swing component-based GUI -- it's a serious flaw that could result in deadlocks or other related threading issues. A pack call causes components to be realized. As they are being realized (that is, not necessarily visible), they could trigger listener notification on the event dispatch thread.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the dispatch race may introduce unexpected behaviour.

* DC: Possible double check of field (DC_DOUBLECHECK)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method may contain an instance of double-checked locking. This idiom is not correct according to the semantics of the Java memory model. For more information, see the web page <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html</a>.

* Close Resource (CloseResource)
** Category: EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Ensure that resources (like Connection, Statement, and ResultSet objects) are always closed after use.
:Makes sure you close your database connections. It does this by looking for code patterned like this: Connection c = X; try { // do stuff, and maybe catch something } finally { c.close(); }
:This rule impacts resources usage, since unneeded open connections take some memory and cpu.

* RCN: Redundant nullcheck of value known to be null  (RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NULL_VALUE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a redundant check of a known null value against the constant null.

* NP: Method tightens nullness annotation on parameter  (NP_METHOD_PARAMETER_TIGHTENS_ANNOTATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A method should always implement the contract of a method it overrides. Thus, if a method takes a parameter that is marked as @Nullable, you shouldn't override that method in a subclass with a method where that parameter is @Nonnull. Doing so violates the contract that the method should handle a null parameter. 

* Preserve Stack Trace (PreserveStackTrace)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Throwing a new exception from a catch block without passing the original exception into the new exception will cause the original stack trace to be lost making it difficult to debug effectively.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the original exception trace is lost.

* SA: Double assignment of local variable   (SA_LOCAL_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a double assignment of a local variable; e.g. <pre>public void foo() { int x,y; x = x = 17; }</pre>. Assigning the same value to a variable twice is useless, and may indicate a logic error or typo.

* USELESS_STRING: Array formatted in useless way using format string  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION_FROM_ARRAY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:One of the arguments being formatted with a format string is an array. This will be formatted using a fairly useless format, such as [I@304282, which doesn't actually show the contents of the array. Consider wrapping the array using <code>Arrays.asList(...)</code> before handling it off to a formatted.

* Equals Null (EqualsNull)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Tests for null should not use the equals() method, since it will throw an exception if the variable is null instead of going in the loop. The '==' operator should be used instead.
:This rule impacts reliability, since a NullPointerException may be thrown if the variable is indeed null.
:TODO: not sure this rule is widely used.

* HE: Class defines hashCode() and uses Object.equals() (HE_HASHCODE_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a <code>hashCode()</code> method but inherits its <code>equals()</code> method from <code>java.lang.Object</code> (which defines equality by comparing object references). Although this will probably satisfy the contract that equal objects must have equal hashcodes, it is probably not what was intended by overriding the <code>hashCode()</code> method. (Overriding <code>hashCode()</code> implies that the object's identity is based on criteria more complicated than simple reference equality.)
:If you don't think instances of this class will ever be inserted into a HashMap/HashTable, the recommended hashCode implementation to use is: <pre>public int hashCode() { assert false : "hashCode not designed"; return 42; // any arbitrary constant will do*/ }</pre>.

* BIT: Incompatible bit masks  (BIT_IOR)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This method compares an expression of the form (e | C) to D. which will always compare unequal due to the specific values of constants C and D. This may indicate a logic error or typo. Typically, this bug occurs because the code wants to perform a membership test in a bit set, but uses the bitwise OR operator ("|") instead of bitwise AND ("&").
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is probably not what was intended.

* USM: Method superfluously delegates to parent class method  (USM_USELESS_SUBCLASS_METHOD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This derived method merely calls the same superclass method passing in the exact parameters received. This method can be removed, as it provides no additional value. 

* TQ: Value annotated as carrying a type qualifier used where a value that must not carry that qualifier is required  (TQ_ALWAYS_VALUE_USED_WHERE_NEVER_REQUIRED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value specified as carrying a type qualifier annotation is consumed in a location or locations requiring that the value not carry that annotation. 
: More precisely, a value annotated with a type qualifier specifying when=ALWAYS is guaranteed to reach a use or uses where the same type qualifier specifies when=NEVER. For example, say that @NonNegative is a nickname for the type qualifier annotation @Negative(when=When.NEVER). The following code will generate this warning because the return statement requires a @NonNegative value, but receives one that is marked as @Negative. <pre>public @NonNegative Integer example(@Negative Integer value) { return value; }</pre>

* Co: Covariant compareTo() method defined (CO_SELF_NO_OBJECT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a covariant version of <code>compareTo()</code>. To correctly override the <code>compareTo()</code> method in the <code>Comparable</code> interface, the parameter of <code>compareTo()</code> must have type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.

* Dm: Method allocates an object, only to get the class object  (DM_NEW_FOR_GETCLASS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method allocates an object just to call getClass() on it, in order to retrieve the Class object for it. It is simpler to just access the .class property of the class.

* OS: Method may fail to close stream  (OS_OPEN_STREAM)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The method creates an IO stream object, does not assign it to any fields, pass it to other methods that might close it, or return it, and does not appear to close the stream on all paths out of the method. This may result in a file descriptor leak. It is generally a good idea to use a <code>finally</code> block to ensure that streams are closed.

* Final Field Could Be Static (FinalFieldCouldBeStatic)
** Category: EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:If a final field is assigned to a compile-time constant, it could be made static, thus saving overhead in each object at runtime.
:This rule impacts resources usage, because of the overhead of the non-static field.

* Empty Static Initializer (EmptyStaticInitializer)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 
** Description:
:An empty static initializer serve no purpose and should be removed.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.

* Eq: Covariant equals() method defined, Object.equals(Object) inherited (EQ_SELF_USE_OBJECT)
** Category: COR REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This class defines a covariant version of the <code>equals()</code> method, but inherits the normal <code>equals(Object)</code> method defined in the base <code>java.lang.Object</code> class. The class should probably define a <code>boolean equals(Object)</code> method. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will be confused by this method's name.

* FS: The type of a supplied argument doesn't match format specifier  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 1
** Description:
:One of the arguments is uncompatible with the corresponding format string specifier. As a result, this will generate a runtime exception when executed. For example, <code>String.format("%d", "1")</code> will generate an exception, since the String "1" is incompatible with the format specifier %d. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since the pattern will throw an exception when executed.

* IJU: JUnit assertion in run method will not be noticed by JUnit  (IJU_ASSERT_METHOD_INVOKED_FROM_RUN_METHOD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A JUnit assertion is performed in a run method. Failed JUnit assertions just result in exceptions being thrown. Thus, if this exception occurs in a thread other than the thread that invokes the test method, the exception will terminate the thread but not result in the test failing. 

* Ru: Invokes run on a thread (did you mean to start it instead?) (RU_INVOKE_RUN)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method explicitly invokes <code>run()</code> on an object. In general, classes implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface because they are going to have their <code>run()</code> method invoked in a new thread, in which case <code>Thread.start()</code> is the right method to call.

* Dont Use Float Type For Loop Indices (DontUseFloatTypeForLoopIndices)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Don't use floating point for loop indices: the termination test may misbehave due to floating point granularity. If you must use floating point, use double unless you're certain that float provides enough precision and you have a compelling performance need (space or time).
:This rule impacts reliability, since the loop may terminate at an unexpected time.

* NP: Non-virtual method call passes null for nonnull parameter  (NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF_NONVIRTUAL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A possibly-null value is passed to a nonnull method parameter. Either the parameter is annotated as a parameter that should always be nonnull, or analysis has shown that it will always be dereferenced. 

* USELESS_STRING: Invocation of toString on an unnamed array  (DMI_INVOKING_TOSTRING_ON_ANONYMOUS_ARRAY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code invokes toString on an (anonymous) array.  Calling toString on an array generates a fairly useless result such as [C@16f0472. Consider using Arrays.toString to convert the array into a readable String that gives the contents of the array. See Programming Puzzlers, chapter 3, puzzle 12. 

* Avoid ThreadGroup (AvoidThreadGroup)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid using java.lang.ThreadGroup; although it is intended to be used in a threaded environment it contains methods that are not thread-safe.
:This pattern impacts the reliability, since a non-thread-safe method may be invoked in a threaded environment.

* Dm: Thread passed where Runnable expected  (DMI_THREAD_PASSED_WHERE_RUNNABLE_EXPECTED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A Thread object is passed as a parameter to a method where a Runnable is expected. This is rather unusual, and may indicate a logic error or cause unexpected behavior. 

* WL: Synchronization on getClass rather than class literal  (WL_USING_GETCLASS_RATHER_THAN_CLASS_LITERAL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This instance method synchronizes on <code>this.getClass()</code>. If this class is subclassed, subclasses will synchronize on the class object for the subclass, which isn't likely what was intended. For example, consider this code from java.awt.Label: <pre>private static final String base = "label"; private static int nameCounter = 0; String constructComponentName() { synchronized (getClass()) { return base + nameCounter++; } }</pre>.
:Subclasses of <code>Label</code> won't synchronize on the same subclass, giving rise to a datarace. Instead, this code should be synchronizing on <code>Label.class</code>: <pre>private static final String base = "label"; private static int nameCounter = 0; String constructComponentName() { synchronized (Label.class) { return base + nameCounter++; } }</pre> --- <em>Bug pattern contributed by Jason Mehrens</em>

* Singular Field (SingularField)
** Category: CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Fields whose scopes are limited to just single methods do not rely on the containing object to provide them to other methods. They may be better implemented as local variables within those methods.
:This rule impacts changeability, since it is easier to modify a variable at the method level than at the class level.

* EI: May expose internal representation by returning reference to mutable object  (EI_EXPOSE_REP)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the object's fields exposes the internal representation of the object. If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do something different. Returning a new copy of the object is better approach in many situations.

* Avoid Protected Field In Final Class (AvoidProtectedFieldInFinalClass)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
: Do not use protected fields in final classes since they cannot be subclassed. Clarify your intent by using private or package access modifiers instead.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the intent of the field modifier is not clear.

* Bad Comparison (BadComparison)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid equality comparisons with Double.NaN. Due to the implicit lack of representation precision when comparing floating point numbers these are likely to cause logic errors.
:This rule impacts reliability, since the comparison may produce unpredictable behaviour because of the floating precision.

* RV: Remainder of hashCode could be negative  (RV_REM_OF_HASHCODE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code computes a hashCode, and then computes the remainder of that value modulo another value. Since the hashCode can be negative, the result of the remainder operation can also be negative. 
:Assuming you want to ensure that the result of your computation is nonnegative, you may need to change your code. If you know the divisor is a power of 2, you can use a bitwise and operator instead (i.e., instead of using <code>x.hashCode()%n</code>, use <code>x.hashCode()&amp;(n-1)</code>. This is probably faster than computing the remainder as well. If you don't know that the divisor is a power of 2, take the absolute value of the result of the remainder operation (i.e., use <code>Math.abs(x.hashCode()%n)</code>

* Position Literals First In Comparisons (PositionLiteralsFirstInComparisons)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Position literals first in comparisons, if the second argument is null then NullPointerExceptions can be avoided, they will just return false.
:This rule impacts reliability, since a NullPointerException will arise if the object is null.

* Dm: Method invokes inefficient Boolean constructor; use Boolean.valueOf (DM_BOOLEAN_CTOR)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Creating new instances of <code>java.lang.Boolean</code> wastes memory, since <code>Boolean</code> objects are immutable and there are only two useful values of this type. Use the <code>Boolean.valueOf()</code> method (or Java 1.5 autoboxing) to create <code>Boolean</code> objects instead.

* NN: Naked notify  (NN_NAKED_NOTIFY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A call to <code>notify()</code> or <code>notifyAll()</code> was made without any (apparent) accompanying modification to mutable object state. In general, calling a notify method on a monitor is done because some condition another thread is waiting for has become true. However, for the condition to be meaningful, it must involve a heap object that is visible to both threads.
:This bug does not necessarily indicate an error, since the change to mutable object state may have taken place in a method which then called the method containing the notification.

* Se: Method must be private in order for serialization to work  (SE_METHOD_MUST_BE_PRIVATE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class implements the <code>Serializable</code> interface, and defines a method for custom serialization/deserialization. But since that method isn't declared private, it will be silently ignored by the serialization/deserialization API.

* PZLA: Consider returning a zero length array rather than null  (PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:It is often a better design to return a length zero array rather than a null reference to indicate that there are no results (i.e., an empty list of results). This way, no explicit check for null is needed by clients of the method.
:On the other hand, using null to indicate "there is no answer to this question" is probably appropriate. For example, <code>File.listFiles()</code> returns an empty list if given a directory containing no files, and returns null if the file is not a directory.

* Misplaced Null Check (MisplacedNullCheck)
** Category: REL ANA
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The null check here is misplaced. If the variable is null a NullPointerException will be thrown. Either the check is useless (the variable will never be 'null') or it is incorrect.
:This pattern impacts the reliability, since an exception may be thrown. It also impacts analysability, since the maintainer will take unnecessary time to understand that the null is misplaced.

* RCN: Redundant comparison of two null values  (RCN_REDUNDANT_COMPARISON_TWO_NULL_VALUES)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a redundant comparison of two references known to both be definitely null.

* MWN: Mismatched notify() (MWN_MISMATCHED_NOTIFY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method calls Object.notify() or Object.notifyAll() without obviously holding a lock on the object.  Calling notify() or notifyAll() without a lock held will result in an <code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code> being thrown.

* MF: Class defines field that masks a superclass field  (MF_CLASS_MASKS_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a field with the same name as a visible instance field in a superclass.  This is confusing, and may indicate an error if methods update or access one of the fields when they wanted the other.

* FE: Doomed test for equality to NaN  (FE_TEST_IF_EQUAL_TO_NOT_A_NUMBER)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This code checks to see if a floating point value is equal to the special Not A Number value (e.g., <code>if (x == Double.NaN)</code>). However, because of the special semantics of <code>NaN</code>, no value is equal to <code>Nan</code>, including <code>NaN</code>. Thus, <code>x == Double.NaN</code> always evaluates to false. To check to see if a value contained in <code>x</code> is the special Not A Number value, use <code>Double.isNaN(x)</code> (or <code>Float.isNaN(x)</code> if <code>x</code> is floating point precision). 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* God Class (GodClass)
** Category: ANA CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The God Class rule detects the God Class design flaw using metrics. God classes do too many things, are very big and overly complex. They should be split apart to be more object-oriented. The rule uses the detection strategy described in 'Object-Oriented Metrics in Practice'. The violations are reported against the entire class. See also the references: Michele Lanza and Radu Marinescu. Object-Oriented Metrics in Practice: Using Software Metrics to Characterize, Evaluate, and Improve the Design of Object-Oriented Systems. Springer, Berlin, 1 edition, October 2006. Page 80.
:This rule impacts analysability, since an overly complex class is difficult to read. It also impact changeability, since separating the various fonctionalities of the class may be difficult.

* Dm: Maps and sets of URLs can be performance hogs  (DMI_COLLECTION_OF_URLS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method or field is or uses a Map or Set of URLs. Since both the equals and hashCode method of URL perform domain name resolution, this can result in a big performance hit. See <a href="http://michaelscharf.blogspot.com/2006/11/javaneturlequals-and-hashcode-make.html">http://michaelscharf.blogspot.com/2006/11/javaneturlequals-and-hashcode-make.html</a> for more information. Consider using <code>java.net.URI</code> instead. 

* Se: The readResolve method must be declared with a return type of Object.   (SE_READ_RESOLVE_MUST_RETURN_OBJECT)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:In order for the readResolve method to be recognized by the serialization mechanism, it must be declared to have a return type of Object. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since an exception may be thrown at runtime when deserialising the object.

* Eq: equals() method defined that doesn't override equals(Object) (EQ_OTHER_NO_OBJECT)
** Category: COR REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This class defines an <code>equals()</code> method, that doesn't override the normal <code>equals(Object)</code> method defined in the base <code>java.lang.Object</code> class. Instead, it inherits an <code>equals(Object)</code> method from a superclass. The class should probably define a <code>boolean equals(Object)</code> method. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will be confused by this method's name.

* Avoid Protected Method In Final Class Not Extending (AvoidProtectedMethodInFinalClassNotExtending)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Do not use protected methods in most final classes since they cannot be subclassed. This should only be allowed in final classes that extend other classes with protected methods (whose visibility cannot be reduced). Clarify your intent by using private or package access modifiers instead.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the intent of the method modifier is not clear.

* BC: Unchecked/unconfirmed cast of return value from method  (BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST_OF_RETURN_VALUE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code performs an unchecked cast of the return value of a method. The code might be calling the method in such a way that the cast is guaranteed to be safe, but FindBugs is unable to verify that the cast is safe.  Check that your program logic ensures that this cast will not fail. 

* FS: Illegal format string  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_ILLEGAL)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 1
** Description:
:The format string is syntactically invalid, and a runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since the pattern will throw an exception when executed.

* Extends Object (ExtendsObject)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:No need to explicitely extend Object, since all objects implicitely inherit from Object.
:This pattern implies unnecessary code and impacts analysability.

* RV: Bad attempt to compute absolute value of signed 32-bit hashcode   (RV_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_OF_HASHCODE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code generates a hashcode and then computes the absolute value of that hashcode.  If the hashcode is <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>, then the result will be negative as well (since <code>Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) == Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>). One out of 2^32 strings have a hashCode of Integer.MIN_VALUE, including "polygenelubricants" "GydZG_" and "DESIGNING WORKHOUSES". 

* NP: Method with Optional return type returns explicit null  (NP_OPTIONAL_RETURN_NULL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The usage of Optional return type always mean that explicit null returns were not desired by design. Returning a null value in such case is a contract violation and will most likely break clients code. 

* Unused Private Method (UnusedPrivateMethod)
** Category: ANA EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Unused Private Method detects when a private method is declared but is unused.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the maintainer will not understand why this method is declared. It also impacts resources, since there is an unused declared method.

* NS: Potentially dangerous use of non-short-circuit logic  (NS_DANGEROUS_NON_SHORT_CIRCUIT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code seems to be using non-short-circuit logic (e.g., &amp; or |) rather than short-circuit logic (&amp;&amp; or ||). In addition, it seem possible that, depending on the value of the left hand side, you might not want to evaluate the right hand side (because it would have side effects, could cause an exception or could be expensive.
:Non-short-circuit logic causes both sides of the expression to be evaluated even when the result can be inferred from knowing the left-hand side. This can be less efficient and can result in errors if the left-hand side guards cases when evaluating the right-hand side can generate an error.
:See <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/expressions.html#15.22.2">the Java Language Specification</a> for details.

* RR: Method ignores results of InputStream.read() (RR_NOT_CHECKED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method ignores the return value of one of the variants of <code>java.io.InputStream.read()</code> which can return multiple bytes. If the return value is not checked, the caller will not be able to correctly handle the case where fewer bytes were read than the caller requested. This is a particularly insidious kind of bug, because in many programs, reads from input streams usually do read the full amount of data requested, causing the program to fail only sporadically.

* LI: Incorrect lazy initialization and update of static field  (LI_LAZY_INIT_UPDATE_STATIC)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a static field. After the field is set, the object stored into that location is further updated or accessed. The setting of the field is visible to other threads as soon as it is set. If the futher accesses in the method that set the field serve to initialize the object, then you have a <em>very serious</em> multithreading bug, unless something else prevents any other thread from accessing the stored object until it is fully initialized. 
:Even if you feel confident that the method is never called by multiple threads, it might be better to not set the static field until the value you are setting it to is fully populated/initialized.

* DMI: Invocation of substring(0), which returns the original value (DMI_USELESS_SUBSTRING)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code invokes substring(0) on a String, which returns the original value. 

* STCAL: Call to static Calendar  (STCAL_INVOKE_ON_STATIC_CALENDAR_INSTANCE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Even though the JavaDoc does not contain a hint about it, Calendars are inherently unsafe for multihtreaded use. The detector has found a call to an instance of Calendar that has been obtained via a static field. This looks suspicous.
:For more information on this see <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6231579">Sun Bug #6231579</a> and <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6178997">Sun Bug #6178997</a>.

* NP: Parameter must be nonnull but is marked as nullable  (NP_PARAMETER_MUST_BE_NONNULL_BUT_MARKED_AS_NULLABLE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This parameter is always used in a way that requires it to be nonnull, but the parameter is explicitly annotated as being Nullable. Either the use of the parameter or the annotation is wrong. 

* Bx: Method allocates a boxed primitive just to call toString  (DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_TOSTRING)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A boxed primitive is allocated just to call toString(). It is more effective to just use the static form of toString which takes the primitive value.
:TODO: Formatting not adapted to contents.

* ICAST: int value cast to float and then passed to Math.round  (ICAST_INT_CAST_TO_FLOAT_PASSED_TO_ROUND)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code converts an int value to a float precision floating point number and then passing the result to the Math.round() function, which returns the int/long closest to the argument. This operation should always be a no-op, since the converting an integer to a float should give a number with no fractional part. It is likely that the operation that generated the value to be passed to Math.round was intended to be performed using floating point arithmetic. 

* Check ResultSet (CheckResultSet)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Always check the return values of navigation methods (next, previous, first, last) of a ResultSet. If the value return is 'false', it should be handled properly.
:This pattern impacts the reliability, since the intended action may not have been performed correctly without the caller to know it.

* Se: serialVersionUID isn't final (SE_NONFINAL_SERIALVERSIONID)
** Category: COR REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This class defines a <code>serialVersionUID</code> field that is not final. The field should be made final if it is intended to specify the version UID for purposes of serialization.
:This rule impact correctness, since ID problems may arise when serialising and deserialising objects. It also impacts reliability, since an exception may be thrown at runtime when deserialising the object.

* BC: instanceof will always return false  (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_INSTANCEOF)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This instanceof test will always return false. Although this is safe, make sure it isn't an indication of some misunderstanding or some other logic error. 
:This rule impacts analysability, since a maintainer will not understand why this useless code has been written. It also impacts correctness, since always returning false was probably not intended.

* FI: Finalizer does nothing but call superclass finalizer  (FI_USELESS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The only thing this <code>finalize()</code> method does is call the superclass's <code>finalize()</code> method, making it redundant. Delete it.

* SQL: A prepared statement is generated from a nonconstant String  (SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The code creates an SQL prepared statement from a nonconstant String. If unchecked, tainted data from a user is used in building this String, SQL injection could be used to make the prepared statement do something unexpected and undesirable. 

* SS: Unread field: should this field be static?  (SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class contains an instance final field that is initialized to a compile-time static value. Consider making the field static.

* UrF: Unread public/protected field  (URF_UNREAD_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This field is never read. The field is public or protected, so perhaps it is intended to be used with classes not seen as part of the analysis. If not, consider removing it from the class.

* BSHIFT: 32 bit int shifted by an amount not in the range -31..31  (ICAST_BAD_SHIFT_AMOUNT)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The code performs shift of a 32 bit int by a constant amount outside the range -31..31. The effect of this is to use the lower 5 bits of the integer value to decide how much to shift by (e.g., shifting by 40 bits is the same as shifting by 8 bits, and shifting by 32 bits is the same as shifting by zero bits). This probably isn't what was expected, and it is at least confusing. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* J2EE: Store of non serializable object into HttpSession  (J2EE_STORE_OF_NON_SERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_INTO_SESSION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code seems to be storing a non-serializable object into an HttpSession. If this session is passivated or migrated, an error will result. 

* NP: Method does not check for null argument (NP_ARGUMENT_MIGHT_BE_NULL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A parameter to this method has been identified as a value that should always be checked to see whether or not it is null, but it is being dereferenced without a preceding null check. 

* HRS: HTTP cookie formed from untrusted input  (HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_COOKIE)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This code constructs an HTTP Cookie using an untrusted HTTP parameter. If this cookie is added to an HTTP response, it will allow a HTTP response splitting vulnerability. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting</a> for more information.
:FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of HTTP response splitting. If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about HTTP response splitting, you should seriouslyconsider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

* CN: Class implements Cloneable but does not define or use clone method  (CN_IDIOM)
** Category:

** Description:
:Class implements Cloneable but does not define or use the clone method.

* Avoid Using Hard Coded IP (AvoidUsingHardCodedIP)
** Category: CHA REU POR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Application with hard-coded IP addresses can become impossible to deploy in some cases. Externalizing IP adresses is preferable.
:This pattern impacts changeability, since it is easier to change the IP in an externalised configuration file. It also impacts reusability, since the hard coded IP address may not be adapted to a different usage. It also impacts portability since the hard coded IP address may not be adapted to a different environment (network

* Nm: Class names shouldn't shadow simple name of superclass (NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_SUPERCLASS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class has a simple name that is identical to that of its superclass, except that its superclass is in a different package (e.g., <code>alpha.Foo</code> extends <code>beta.Foo</code>). This can be exceptionally confusing, create lots of situations in which you have to look at import statements to resolve references and creates many opportunities to accidently define methods that do not override methods in their superclasses. 

* PT: Relative path traversal in servlet  (PT_RELATIVE_PATH_TRAVERSAL)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:The software uses an HTTP request parameter to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory. See <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html">http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html</a> for more information.
:FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of absolute path traversal. If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about absolute path traversal, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

* BOA: Class overrides a method implemented in super class Adapter wrongly  (BOA_BADLY_OVERRIDDEN_ADAPTER)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This method overrides a method found in a parent class, where that class is an Adapter that implements a listener defined in the java.awt.event or javax.swing.event package. As a result, this method will not get called when the event occurs.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* IM: Check for oddness that won't work for negative numbers   (IM_BAD_CHECK_FOR_ODD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code uses x % 2 == 1 to check to see if a value is odd, but this won't work for negative numbers (e.g., (-5) % 2 == -1). If this code is intending to check for oddness, consider using x &amp; 1 == 1, or x % 2 != 0. 

* RR: Method ignores results of InputStream.skip() (SR_NOT_CHECKED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method ignores the return value of <code>java.io.InputStream.skip()</code> which can skip multiple bytes. If the return value is not checked, the caller will not be able to correctly handle the case where fewer bytes were skipped than the caller requested. This is a particularly insidious kind of bug, because in many programs, skips from input streams usually do skip the full amount of data requested, causing the program to fail only sporadically. With Buffered streams, however, <code>skip()</code> will only skip data in the buffer, and will routinely fail to skip the requested number of bytes.

* FS: MessageFormat supplied where printf style format expected  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXPECTED_MESSAGE_FORMAT_SUPPLIED)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A method is called that expects a Java printf format string and a list of arguments. However, the format string doesn't contain any format specifiers (e.g., %s) but does contain message format elements (e.g., {0}).  It is likely that the code is supplying a MessageFormat string when a printf-style format string is required. At runtime, all of the arguments will be ignored and the format string will be returned exactly as provided without any formatting. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* SF: Switch statement found where default case is missing  (SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a switch statement where default case is missing. Usually you need to provide a default case.
:Because the analysis only looks at the generated bytecode, this warning can be incorrect triggered if the default case is at the end of the switch statement and doesn't end with a break statement.

* EC: equals(...) used to compare incompatible arrays (EC_INCOMPATIBLE_ARRAY_COMPARE)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This method invokes the .equals(Object o) to compare two arrays, but the arrays are of incompatible types (e.g., String[] and StringBuffer[], or String[] and int[]). They will never be equal. In addition, when equals(...) is used to compare arrays it only checks to see if they are the same array, and ignores the contents of the arrays. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* IP: A parameter is dead upon entry to a method but overwritten  (IP_PARAMETER_IS_DEAD_BUT_OVERWRITTEN)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The initial value of this parameter is ignored, and the parameter is overwritten here. This often indicates a mistaken belief that the write to the parameter will be conveyed back to the caller. 

* USELESS_STRING: Invocation of toString on an array  (DMI_INVOKING_TOSTRING_ON_ARRAY)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:The code invokes toString on an array, which will generate a fairly useless result such as [C@16f0472. Consider using Arrays.toString to convert the array into a readable String that gives the contents of the array. See Programming Puzzlers, chapter 3, puzzle 12.

* DMI: Double.longBitsToDouble invoked on an int  (DMI_LONG_BITS_TO_DOUBLE_INVOKED_ON_INT)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:The Double.longBitsToDouble method is invoked, but a 32 bit int value is passed as an argument. This almostly certainly is not intended and is unlikely to give the intended result. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* Eq: Equals checks for incompatible operand  (EQ_CHECK_FOR_OPERAND_NOT_COMPATIBLE_WITH_THIS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This equals method is checking to see if the argument is some incompatible type (i.e., a class that is neither a supertype nor subtype of the class that defines the equals method). For example, the Foo class might have an equals method that looks like: <pre>public boolean equals(Object o) { if (o instanceof Foo) return name.equals(((Foo)o).name); else if (o instanceof String) return name.equals(o); else return false;</pre>
:This is considered bad practice, as it makes it very hard to implement an equals method that is symmetric and transitive. Without those properties, very unexpected behavoirs are possible. 

* ICAST: int value converted to long and used as absolute time (ICAST_INT_2_LONG_AS_INSTANT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code converts a 32-bit int value to a 64-bit long value, and then passes that value for a method parameter that requires an absolute time value. An absolute time value is the number of milliseconds since the standard base time known as <em>the epoch</em>, namely January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. For example, the following method, intended to convert seconds since the epoc into a Date, is badly broken: <pre>Date getDate(int seconds) { return new Date(seconds * 1000); } </pre>.
:The multiplication is done using 32-bit arithmetic, and then converted to a 64-bit value. When a 32-bit value is converted to 64-bits and used to express an absolute time value, only dates in December 1969 and January 1970 can be represented.
:Correct implementations for the above method are: <pre>// Fails for dates after 2037
 Date getDate(int seconds) { return new Date(seconds * 1000L); } 
// better, works for all dates 
 Date getDate(long seconds) { return new Date(seconds * 1000); }</pre>

* XSS: Servlet reflected cross site scripting vulnerability  (XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SERVLET_WRITER)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to Servlet output, which allows for a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting</a> for more information.
:FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of cross site scripting. If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more cross site scripting vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about cross site scripting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

* Loose Coupling (LooseCoupling)
** Category: REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The use of implementation types as object references limits your ability to use alternate implementations in the future as requirements change. Whenever available, referencing objects by their interface types provides much more flexibility.
:This rule impacts reusability, since many classes need to be available for this class to work.

* RV: Method discards result of readLine after checking if it is nonnull  (RV_DONT_JUST_NULL_CHECK_READLINE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The value returned by readLine is discarded after checking to see if the return value is non-null. In almost all situations, if the result is non-null, you will want to use that non-null value. Calling readLine again will give you a different line.

* QBA: Method assigns boolean literal in boolean expression  (QBA_QUESTIONABLE_BOOLEAN_ASSIGNMENT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method assigns a literal boolean value (true or false) to a boolean variable inside an if or while expression. Most probably this was supposed to be a boolean comparison using ==, not an assignment using =. 

* UwF: Unwritten field  (UWF_UNWRITTEN_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This field is never written. All reads of it will return the default value. Check for errors (should it have been initialized?), or remove it if it is useless.

* TQ: Value required to not have type qualifier, but marked as unknown  (TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINK)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value is used in a way that requires it to be never be a value denoted by a type qualifier, but there is an explicit annotation stating that it is not known where the value is prohibited from having that type qualifier. Either the usage or the annotation is incorrect. 

* RV: Method ignores exceptional return value  (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE)
** Category: MAT
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This method returns a value that is not checked. The return value should be checked since it can indicate an unusual or unexpected function execution. For example, the <code>File.delete()</code> method returns false if the file could not be successfully deleted (rather than throwing an Exception). If you don't check the result, you won't notice if the method invocation signals unexpected behavior by returning an atypical return value. 
:This rule impacts maturity, since it implies better control on the program execution.

* Unsynchronized Static Date Formatter (UnsynchronizedStaticDateFormatter)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:SimpleDateFormat instances are not synchronized. Sun recommends using separate format instances for each thread. If multiple threads must access a static formatter, the formatter must be synchronized either on method or block level.
:Using a DateFormatter (SimpleDateFormatter) which is static can cause unexpected results when used in a multi-threaded environment. This rule will find static (Simple)DateFormatters which are used in an unsynchronized manner. Refer to these Bug Parade issues: 4093418 4228335 4261469 see RFE1020790 - Check for SimpleDateFormat as singleton http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1020790&group_id=56262&atid=479924
:This rule impacts reliability, since an unexpected behaviour may arise from the thread's synchronisation.

* Dm: Empty database password  (DMI_EMPTY_DB_PASSWORD)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This code creates a database connect using a blank or empty password. This indicates that the database is not protected by a password. 

* FS: Non-Boolean argument formatted using %b format specifier  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION_TO_BOOLEAN)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:An argument not of type Boolean is being formatted with a %b format specifier. This won't throw an exception; instead, it will print true for any nonnull value, and false for null. This feature of format strings is strange, and may not be what you intended. 

* HRS: HTTP Response splitting vulnerability  (HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_HTTP_HEADER)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to an HTTP header, which allows for a HTTP response splitting vulnerability. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting</a> for more information.
:FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of HTTP response splitting. If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about HTTP response splitting, you should seriouslyconsider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

* RCN: Redundant nullcheck of value known to be non-null  (RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a redundant check of a known non-null value against the constant null.

* Dont Call ThreadRun (DontCallThreadRun)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:Explicitly calling Thread.run() method will execute in the caller's thread of control. Instead, call Thread.start() for the intended behavior.
:This rule impacts analysability, since a maintainer will have trouble understanding the intended behaviour.

* Position Literals First In Case Insensitive Comparisons (PositionLiteralsFirstInCaseInsensitiveComparisons)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Position literals first in comparisons, if the second argument is null then NullPointerExceptions can be avoided, they will just return false.
:This rule impacts reliability, since a NullPointerException will arise if the object is null.

* VA: Primitive array passed to function expecting a variable number of object arguments  (VA_PRIMITIVE_ARRAY_PASSED_TO_OBJECT_VARARG)
** Category: COR EFF
** Priority: 5
** Description:
:This code passes a primitive array to a function that takes a variable number of object arguments. This creates an array of length one to hold the primitive array and passes it to the function. 

* BIT: Check for sign of bitwise operation  (BIT_SIGNED_CHECK_HIGH_BIT)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This method compares an expression such as <pre>((event.detail &amp; SWT.SELECTED) &gt; 0)</pre>. Using bit arithmetic and then comparing with the greater than operator can lead to unexpected results (of course depending on the value of SWT.SELECTED). If SWT.SELECTED is a negative number, this is a candidate for a bug. Even when SWT.SELECTED is not negative, it seems good practice to use "!= 0" instead of "&gt; 0". 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* Default Label Not Last In Switch Statement (DefaultLabelNotLastInSwitchStmt)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:By convention, the default label should be the last label in a switch statement.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the maintainer will have trouble seeing the default case.

* IC: Superclass uses subclass during initialization  (IC_SUPERCLASS_USES_SUBCLASS_DURING_INITIALIZATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:During the initialization of a class, the class makes an active use of a subclass. That subclass will not yet be initialized at the time of this use. For example, in the following code, <code>foo</code> will be null. <pre>public class CircularClassInitialization { static class InnerClassSingleton extends CircularClassInitialization { static InnerClassSingleton singleton = new InnerClassSingleton(); } static CircularClassInitialization foo = InnerClassSingleton.singleton; }</pre>.

* UwF: Unwritten public or protected field  (UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:No writes were seen to this public/protected field. All reads of it will return the default value. Check for errors (should it have been initialized?), or remove it if it is useless.

* Dm: Method invokes inefficient new String() constructor (DM_STRING_VOID_CTOR)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Creating a new <code>java.lang.String</code> object using the no-argument constructor wastes memory because the object so created will be functionally indistinguishable from the empty string constant <code>""</code>. Java guarantees that identical string constants will be represented by the same <code>String</code> object. Therefore, you should just use the empty string constant directly.

* Avoid Instanceof() Checks In Catch Clause (AvoidInstanceofChecksInCatchClause)
** Category: CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Each caught exception type should be handled in its own catch clause.
:This rule impacts changeability, since the type of exception and its treatment is straight-forward.

* BC: Impossible cast  (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_CAST)
** Category: COR REL
** Priority: 1
** Description:
:This cast will always throw a ClassCastException. FindBugs tracks type information from instanceof checks, and also uses more precise information about the types of values returned from methods and loaded from fields. Thus, it may have more precise information that just the declared type of a variable, and can use this to determine that a cast will always throw an exception at runtime. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since an exception will be thrown. It also impacts correctness, since invariably throwing an exception was probably not what was intended.

* Instantiation To Get Class (InstantiationToGetClass)
** Category: EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid instantiating an object just to call getClass() on it; use the .class public member instead.
:This rule impacts resources, since the object will be unnecessarily created.

* DMI: Reversed method arguments  (DMI_ARGUMENTS_WRONG_ORDER)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The arguments to this method call seem to be in the wrong order. For example, a call <code>Preconditions.checkNotNull("message", message)</code> has reserved arguments: the value to be checked is the first argument. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it implies useless code.

* HE: Use of class without a hashCode() method in a hashed data structure  (HE_USE_OF_UNHASHABLE_CLASS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A class defines an equals(Object)  method but not a hashCode() method, and thus doesn't fulfill the requirement that equal objects have equal hashCodes. An instance of this class is used in a hash data structure, making the need to fix this problem of highest importance.

* DMI: Non serializable object written to ObjectOutput  (DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code seems to be passing a non-serializable object to the ObjectOutput.writeObject method. If the object is, indeed, non-serializable, an error will result. 

* DMI: Code contains a hard coded reference to an absolute pathname  (DMI_HARDCODED_ABSOLUTE_FILENAME)

** Description:
:This code constructs a File object using a hard coded to an absolute pathname (e.g., <code>new File("/home/dannyc/workspace/j2ee/src/share/com/sun/enterprise/deployment");</code> 

* NP: Method call passes null for nonnull parameter  (NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method call passes a null value for a nonnull method parameter. Either the parameter is annotated as a parameter that should always be nonnull, or analysis has shown that it will always be dereferenced. 

* Se: Non-serializable class has a serializable inner class  (SE_BAD_FIELD_INNER_CLASS)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This Serializable class is an inner class of a non-serializable class. Thus, attempts to serialize it will also attempt to associate instance of the outer class with which it is associated, leading to a runtime error. If possible, making the inner class a static inner class should solve the problem. Making the outer class serializable might also work, but that would mean serializing an instance of the inner class would always also serialize the instance of the outer class, which it often not what you really want. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since an exception will occur when attempting to serialise the inner class.

* Empty If Stmt (EmptyIfStmt)
** Category: ANA EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Empty If Statement finds instances where a condition is checked but nothing is done about it.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it introduces unnecessary code. It also impacts resources, since it takes unnecessary space and cpu.

* Check SkipResult (CheckSkipResult)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The <code>skip()</code> method may skip a smaller number of bytes than requested. Check the returned value to find out if it was the case or not.
:This rule impacts reliability, since the call may not have produced the intended result.

* Dm: Useless/vacuous call to EasyMock method  (DMI_VACUOUS_CALL_TO_EASYMOCK_METHOD)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This call doesn't pass any objects to the EasyMock method, so the call doesn't do anything. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since this represents useless code.

* DMI: Bad constant value for month  (DMI_BAD_MONTH)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This code passes a constant month value outside the expected range of 0..11 to a method. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* Jumbled Incrementer (JumbledIncrementer)
** Category: CHA REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid jumbled loop incrementers - it is usually a mistake, and is confusing even if intentional.
:It impacts changeability, since modifying the loop will probably have some side-effects. It also impacts reliability by increasing the complexity of code, thus inducing more opportunities for bugs.

* MS: May expose internal static state by storing a mutable object into a static field  (EI_EXPOSE_STATIC_REP2)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into a static field. If unchecked changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do something different. Storing a copy of the object is better approach in many situations.

* Unused Private Field (UnusedPrivateField)
** Category: ANA EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Detects when a private field is declared and/or assigned a value, but not used.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the maintainer will not understand why this field is declared. It also impacts resources, since there is an unused declared field.

* Co: Abstract class defines covariant compareTo() method (CO_ABSTRACT_SELF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a covariant version of <code>compareTo()</code>. To correctly override the <code>compareTo()</code> method in the <code>Comparable</code> interface, the parameter of <code>compareTo()</code> must have type <code>java.lang.Object</code>..

* INT: Integer remainder modulo 1  (INT_BAD_REM_BY_1)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Any expression (exp % 1) is guaranteed to always return zero. Did you mean (exp &amp; 1) or (exp % 2) instead? 

* Assignment To Non Final Static (AssignmentToNonFinalStatic)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Identifies a possible unsafe usage of a static field.
:This rule impacts reliability, since the variable may be modified by another calls, producing an unpredictable behaviour.

* IO: Doomed attempt to append to an object output stream  (IO_APPENDING_TO_OBJECT_OUTPUT_STREAM)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code opens a file in append mode and then wraps the result in an object output stream. This won't allow you to append to an existing object output stream stored in a file. If you want to be able to append to an object output stream, you need to keep the object output stream open.
:The only situation in which opening a file in append mode and the writing an object output stream could work is if on reading the file you plan to open it in random access mode and seek to the byte offset where the append started.

* IS: Inconsistent synchronization  (IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC)
** Category: COR THR
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:The fields of this class appear to be accessed inconsistently with respect to synchronization. This bug report indicates that the bug pattern detector judged that 1. the class contains a mix of locked and unlocked accesses, 2. the class is <b>not</b> annotated as javax.annotation.concurrent.NotThreadSafe, 3. at least one locked access was performed by one of the class's own methods, and 4. the number of unsynchronized field accesses (reads and writes) was no more than one third of all accesses, with writes being weighed twice as high as reads
:A typical bug matching this bug pattern is forgetting to synchronize one of the methods in a class that is intended to be thread-safe. You can select the nodes labeled "Unsynchronized access" to show the code locations where the detector believed that a field was accessed without synchronization.
:Note that there are various sources of inaccuracy in this detector; for example, the detector cannot statically detect all situations in which a lock is held. Also, even when the detector is accurate in distinguishing locked vs. unlocked accesses, the code in question may still be correct.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the fields may be accessed inconsistently. It may produce false positives.

* QF: Complicated, subtle or wrong increment in for-loop   (QF_QUESTIONABLE_FOR_LOOP)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Are you sure this for loop is incrementing the correct variable? It appears that another variable is being initialized and checked by the for loop. 

* MTIA: Class extends Servlet class and uses instance variables  (MTIA_SUSPECT_SERVLET_INSTANCE_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class extends from a Servlet class, and uses an instance member variable. Since only one instance of a Servlet class is created by the J2EE framework, and used in a multithreaded way, this paradigm is highly discouraged and most likely problematic. Consider only using method local variables. 

* NP: Null pointer dereference in method on exception path  (NP_ALWAYS_NULL_EXCEPTION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A pointer which is null on an exception path is dereferenced here. This will lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed. Note that because FindBugs currently does not prune infeasible exception paths, this may be a false warning.
:Also note that FindBugs considers the default case of a switch statement to be an exception path, since the default case is often infeasible.

* Use Varargs (UseVarargs)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Java 5 introduced the varargs parameter declaration for methods and constructors. This syntactic sugar provides flexibility for users of these methods and constructors, allowing them to avoid having to deal with the creation of an array.
:This rule impacts analysability, since varargs were intended to be easier to read than arrays.

* Se: Non-transient non-serializable instance field in serializable class  (SE_BAD_FIELD)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This Serializable class defines a non-primitive instance field which is neither transient, Serializable, or <code>java.lang.Object</code>, and does not appear to implement the <code>Externalizable</code> interface or the <code>readObject()</code> and <code>writeObject()</code> methods. Objects of this class will not be deserialised correctly if a non-Serializable object is stored in this field.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the class may be wrongly deserialised.

* DLS: Useless assignment in return statement  (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_IN_RETURN)
** Category:

** Description:
:This statement assigns to a local variable in a return statement. This assignment has effect. Please verify that this statement does the right thing. 

* NS: Questionable use of non-short-circuit logic  (NS_NON_SHORT_CIRCUIT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code seems to be using non-short-circuit logic (e.g., &amp; or |) rather than short-circuit logic (&amp;&amp; or ||). Non-short-circuit logic causes both sides of the expression to be evaluated even when the result can be inferred from knowing the left-hand side. This can be less efficient and can result in errors if the left-hand side guards cases when evaluating the right-hand side can generate an error. See <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/expressions.html#15.22.2">the Java Language Specification</a> for details.

:This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to JSP output, which allows for a cross site scripting vulnerability. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting</a> for more information.
:FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of cross site scripting. If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more cross site scripting vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about cross site scripting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

* UwF: Field not initialized in constructor but dereferenced without null check  (UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This field is never initialized within any constructor, and is therefore could be null after the object is constructed. Elsewhere, it is loaded and dereferenced without a null check. This could be a either an error or a questionable design, since it means a null pointer exception will be generated if that field is dereferenced before being initialized. 

* PZ: Don't reuse entry objects in iterators  (PZ_DONT_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTS_IN_ITERATORS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The entrySet() method is allowed to return a view of the underlying Map in which an Iterator and Map.Entry. This clever idea was used in several Map implementations, but introduces the possibility of nasty coding mistakes. If a map <code>m</code> returns such an iterator for an entrySet, then <code>c.addAll(m.entrySet())</code> will go badly wrong. All of the Map implementations in OpenJDK 1.7 have been rewritten to avoid this, you should to. 

* DMI: Adding elements of an entry set may fail due to reuse of Entry objects  (DMI_ENTRY_SETS_MAY_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The entrySet() method is allowed to return a view of the underlying Map in which a single Entry object is reused and returned during the iteration.  As of Java 1.6, both IdentityHashMap and EnumMap did so. When iterating through such a Map, the Entry value is only valid until you advance to the next iteration. If, for example, you try to pass such an entrySet to an addAll method, things will go badly wrong. 

* Collapsible If Statements (CollapsibleIfStatements)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Sometimes two consecutive 'if' statements can be consolidated by separating their conditions with a boolean short-circuit operator.
:Collapsible if statements add unnecessary code and complexity.

* SA: Self assignment of local variable  (SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a self assignment of a local variable; e.g.</p> <pre> public void foo() { int x = 3; x = x; } </pre> Such assignments are useless, and may indicate a logic error or typo. 

* RE: "." or "|" used for regular expression  (RE_POSSIBLE_UNINTENDED_PATTERN)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A String function is being invoked and "." or "|" is being passed to a parameter that takes a regular expression as an argument. Is this what you intended? For example <ul><li>s.replaceAll(".", "/") will return a String in which <em>every</em> character has been replaced by a "/" character</li> <li>s.split(".") <em>always</em> returns a zero length array of String</li> <li>"ab|cd".replaceAll("|", "/") will return "/a/b/|/c/d/"</li> <li>"ab|cd".split("|") will return array with six (!) elements: [, a, b, |, c, d].</li></ul>

* SI: Static initializer creates instance before all static final fields assigned  (SI_INSTANCE_BEFORE_FINALS_ASSIGNED)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The class's static initializer creates an instance of the class before all of the static final fields are assigned.
:This rule impacts correctness, since unexpected behaviour may result from using unassigned fields.

* Se: Transient field that isn't set by deserialization.   (SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_NOT_RESTORED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class contains a field that is updated at multiple places in the class, thus it seems to be part of the state of the class. However, since the field is marked as transient and not set in readObject or readResolve, it will contain the default value in any deserialized instance of the class. 

* JLM: Synchronization performed on util.concurrent instance  (JLM_JSR166_UTILCONCURRENT_MONITORENTER)
** Category: COR CHA THR
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This method performs synchronization an object that is an instance of a class from the java.util.concurrent package (or its subclasses). Instances of these classes have their own concurrency control mechanisms that are orthogonal to the synchronization provided by the Java keyword <code>synchronized</code>. For example, synchronizing on an <code>AtomicBoolean</code> will not prevent other threads from modifying the  <code>AtomicBoolean</code>.
:Such code may be correct, but should be carefully reviewed and documented, and may confuse people who have to maintain the code at a later date.
:This rule impacts correctness, since different concurrency mechanims may introduce unexpected results. It also impacts changeability, since maintainers will be confused by the different concurrency mechanisms.

* CD: Test for circular dependencies among classes  (CD_CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class has a circular dependency with other classes. This makes building these classes difficult, as each is dependent on the other to build correctly. Consider using interfaces to break the hard dependency. 

* NP: Null value is guaranteed to be dereferenced (NP_GUARANTEED_DEREF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:There is a statement or branch that if executed guarantees that a value is null at this point, and that value that is guaranteed to be dereferenced (except on forward paths involving runtime exceptions). Note that a check such as <code>if (x == null) throw new NullPointerException();</code> is treated as a dereference of x. 

* Avoid Deeply Nested If Statements (AvoidDeeplyNestedIfStmts)
** Category: ANA CHA TES
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid creating deeply nested if-then statements since they are harder to read and error-prone to maintain. The nesting threshold can be configured by the user, default value is 3.
:This rule impacts analysability, since deeply nested control structure are hard to understand past a given threshold. It also impacts changeability, since a maintainer will need to check the whole structure to apply a change. It also impacts testability, since it increases the number of paths to check.

* SQL: Method attempts to access a prepared statement parameter with index 0  (SQL_BAD_PREPARED_STATEMENT_ACCESS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A call to a setXXX method of a prepared statement was made where the parameter index is 0. As parameter indexes start at index 1, this is always a mistake.

* PS: Class exposes synchronization and semaphores in its public interface  (PS_PUBLIC_SEMAPHORES)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class uses synchronization along with wait(), notify() or notifyAll() on itself (the this reference). Client classes that use this class, may, in addition, use an instance of this class as a synchronizing object. Because two classes are using the same object for synchronization, Multithread correctness is suspect. You should not synchronize nor call semaphore methods on a public reference. Consider using a internal private member variable to control synchronization. 

* ICAST: Result of integer multiplication cast to long  (ICAST_INTEGER_MULTIPLY_CAST_TO_LONG)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code performs integer multiply and then converts the result to a long, as in: <pre>long convertDaysToMilliseconds(int days) { return 1000*3600*24*days; }</pre>.
:If the multiplication is done using long arithmetic, you can avoid the possibility that the result will overflow. For example, you could fix the above code to: <pre>long convertDaysToMilliseconds(int days) { return 1000L*3600*24*days; }</pre> or <pre>static final long MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 24L*3600*1000; long convertDaysToMilliseconds(int days) { return days * MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY; }</pre>

* Nm: Class is not derived from an Exception, even though it is named as such  (NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class is not derived from another exception, but ends with "Exception". This will be confusing to users of this class.

* BC: Questionable cast to concrete collection  (BC_BAD_CAST_TO_CONCRETE_COLLECTION)
** Category: CHA
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This code casts an abstract collection (such as a Collection, List, or Set) to a specific concrete implementation (such as an ArrayList or HashSet). This might not be correct, and it may make your code fragile, since it makes it harder to switch to other concrete implementations at a future point. Unless you have a particular reason to do so, just use the abstract collection class. 

* Dm: Creation of ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor with zero core threads  (DMI_SCHEDULED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR_WITH_ZERO_CORE_THREADS)
** Category: COR CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:(<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html#ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(int)">Javadoc</a>) A ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor with zero core threads will never execute anything; changes to the max pool size are ignored. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts changeability, since a maintainer might try to change the pool size without effect.

* VO: An increment to a volatile field isn't atomic  (VO_VOLATILE_INCREMENT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code increments a volatile field. Increments of volatile fields aren't atomic. If more than one thread is incrementing the field at the same time, increments could be lost. 

* SQL: Method attempts to access a result set field with index 0  (SQL_BAD_RESULTSET_ACCESS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A call to getXXX or updateXXX methods of a result set was made where the field index is 0. As ResultSet fields start at index 1, this is always a mistake.

* RV: Method ignores return value  (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The return value of this method should be checked. One common cause of this warning is to invoke a method on an immutable object, thinking that it updates the object. For example, in the following code fragment, <code>String dateString = getHeaderField(name); dateString.trim();</code> the programmer seems to be thinking that the trim() method will update the String referenced by dateString. But since Strings are immutable, the trim() function returns a new String value, which is being ignored here. The code should be corrected to: <code>String dateString = getHeaderField(name); dateString = dateString.trim();</code>.

* Switch Statements Should Have Default (SwitchStmtsShouldHaveDefault)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:All switch statements should include a default option to catch any unspecified values.
:This rule impacts reliability, since an unpredictable behaviour may result if the switch value was not intended.

* IJU: TestCase defines tearDown that doesn't call super.tearDown() (IJU_TEARDOWN_NO_SUPER)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Class is a JUnit TestCase and implements the tearDown method. The tearDown method should call super.tearDown(), but doesn't.

* Accessor Class Generation (AccessorClassGeneration)
** Category: 
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Instantiation by way of private constructors from outside of the constructor's class often causes the generation of an accessor. A factory method, or non-privatization of the constructor can eliminate this situation. The generated class file is actually an interface. It gives the accessing class the ability to invoke a new hidden package scope constructor that takes the interface as a supplementary parameter. This turns a private constructor effectively into one with package scope, and is challenging to discern.
:Javadoc's description of the execution: 1. Note all private constructors. 2. Note all instantiations from outside of the class by way of the private constructor. 3. Flag instantiations.

* NP: Value is null and guaranteed to be dereferenced on exception path  (NP_GUARANTEED_DEREF_ON_EXCEPTION_PATH)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:There is a statement or branch on an exception path that if executed guarantees that a value is null at this point, and that value that is guaranteed to be dereferenced (except on forward paths involving runtime exceptions). 

* HSC: Huge string constants is duplicated across multiple class files  (HSC_HUGE_SHARED_STRING_CONSTANT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A large String constant is duplicated across multiple class files. This is likely because a final field is initialized to a String constant, and the Java language mandates that all references to a final field from other classes be inlined into that classfile. See <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6447475">JDK bug 6447475</a> for a description of an occurrence of this bug in the JDK and how resolving it reduced the size of the JDK by 1 megabyte. 

* IIO: Inefficient use of String.indexOf(String) (IIO_INEFFICIENT_INDEX_OF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code passes a constant string of length 1 to String.indexOf(). It is more efficient to use the integer implementations of String.indexOf(). f. e. call <code>myString.indexOf('.')</code> instead of <code>myString.indexOf(".")</code>

* UL: Method does not release lock on all exception paths  (UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK_EXCEPTION_PATH)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method acquires a JSR-166 (<code>java.util.concurrent</code>) lock, but does not release it on all exception paths out of the method.  In general, the correct idiom for using a JSR-166 lock is:  <pre>Lock l = ...; l.lock(); try { /* do something */ } finally { l.unlock(); }</pre>

* NP: Possible null pointer dereference due to return value of called method  (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_FROM_RETURN_VALUE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The return value from a method is dereferenced without a null check, and the return value of that method is one that should generally be checked for null.  This may lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed. 

* SnVI: Class is Serializable, but doesn't define serialVersionUID  (SE_NO_SERIALVERSIONID)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class implements the <code>Serializable</code> interface, but does not define a <code>serialVersionUID</code> field. A change as simple as adding a reference to a .class object will add synthetic fields to the class, which will unfortunately change the implicit serialVersionUID (e.g., adding a reference to <code>String.class</code> will generate a static field <code>class$java$lang$String</code>). Also, different source code to bytecode compilers may use different naming conventions for synthetic variables generated for references to class objects or inner classes. To ensure interoperability of Serializable across versions, consider adding an explicit serialVersionUID.

* Se: Transient field of class that isn't Serializable.   (SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_OF_NONSERIALIZABLE_CLASS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The field is marked as transient, but the class isn't Serializable, so marking it as transient has absolutely no effect. This may be leftover marking from a previous version of the code in which the class was transient, or it may indicate a misunderstanding of how serialization works. 

* DL: Synchronization on interned String   (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_SHARED_CONSTANT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code synchronizes on interned String. <pre> private static String LOCK = "LOCK"; ... synchronized(LOCK) { ...} ... </pre> Constant Strings are interned and shared across all other classes loaded by the JVM. Thus, this could is locking on something that other code might also be locking. This could result in very strange and hard to diagnose blocking and deadlock behavior. See <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t96352.html">http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t96352.html</a> and <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-352">http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-352</a>.

* WS: Class's writeObject() method is synchronized but nothing else is (WS_WRITEOBJECT_SYNC)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class has a <code>writeObject()</code> method which is synchronized; however, no other method of the class is synchronized.

* Dm: Method invokes dangerous method runFinalizersOnExit  (DM_RUN_FINALIZERS_ON_EXIT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:<em>Never call System.runFinalizersOnExit or Runtime.runFinalizersOnExit for any reason: they are among the most dangerous methods in the Java libraries.</em> -- Joshua Bloch

* PT: Absolute path traversal in servlet  (PT_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TRAVERSAL)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:The software uses an HTTP request parameter to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory. See <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html">http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html</a> for more information.
:FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of absolute path traversal. If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about absolute path traversal, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

* TQ: Value that might not carry a type qualifier is always used in a way that requires type qualifier  (TQ_MAYBE_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_ALWAYS_SINK)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value that is annotated as possibility not being an instance of the values denoted by the type qualifier, and the value is guaranteed to be used in a way that requires values denoted by that type qualifier. 

* For Loop Should Be While Loop (ForLoopShouldBeWhileLoop)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Some for loops can be simplified to while loops, this makes them more concise.
:A maintainer will wonder why a for loop is used without condition. While loops are also more concise.

* DMI: hasNext method invokes next  (DMI_CALLING_NEXT_FROM_HASNEXT)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The hasNext() method invokes the next() method. This is almost certainly wrong, since the hasNext() method is not supposed to change the state of the iterator, and the next method is supposed to change the state of the iterator. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is probably not what was intended.

* BC: Impossible downcast of toArray() result (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST_OF_TOARRAY)
** Category: COR REL
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This code is casting the result of calling <code>toArray()</code> on a collection to a type more specific than <code>Object[]</code>, as in: <pre>String[] getAsArray(Collection<String> c) { return (String[]) c.toArray(); }</pre>.
:This will usually fail by throwing a ClassCastException. The toArray() of almost all collections return an Object[]. They can't really do anything else, since the Collection object has no reference to the declared generic type of the collection. The correct way to do get an array of a specific type from a collection is to use c.toArray(new String[]); or c.toArray(new String[c.size()]); (the latter is slightly more efficient).
:There is one common/known exception exception to this. The toArray() method of lists returned by Arrays.asList(...) will return a covariantly typed array. For example, Arrays.asArray(new String[] { "a" }).toArray() will return a String []. FindBugs attempts to detect and suppress such cases, but may miss some. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since an exception may be thrown. It also impacts correctness since invariably throwing an exception was probably not what was intended. There may be some false positives.

* Non Case Label In Switch Statement (NonCaseLabelInSwitchStatement)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A non-case label (e.g. a named break/continue label) was present in a switch statement. This is legal, but confusing. It is easy to mix up the case labels and the non-case labels.
:This rule impacts analysability, since this may confuse the maintainer when reading the switch. By the way, introducing a label <i>in</i> the switch creates an intricate control flow and is discouraged.

* UMAC: Uncallable method defined in anonymous class  (UMAC_UNCALLABLE_METHOD_OF_ANONYMOUS_CLASS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This anonymous class defined a method that is not directly invoked and does not override a method in a superclass. Since methods in other classes cannot directly invoke methods declared in an anonymous class, it seems that this method is uncallable. The method might simply be dead code, but it is also possible that the method is intended to override a method declared in a superclass, and due to an typo or other error the method does not, in fact, override the method it is intended to. 

* FI: Finalizer nulls fields (FI_FINALIZER_NULLS_FIELDS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This finalizer nulls out fields.  This is usually an error, as it does not aid garbage collection, and the object is going to be garbage collected anyway.

* Empty While Stmt (EmptyWhileStmt)
** Category: ANA EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Empty While Statement finds all instances where a while statement does nothing. If it is a timing loop, then you should use Thread.sleep() for it; if it is a while loop that does a lot in the exit expression, rewrite it to make it clearer.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it introduces unnecessary code. It also impacts resources, since it takes unnecessary space and cpu.

* Double Checked Locking (DoubleCheckedLocking)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Partially created objects can be returned by the Double Checked Locking pattern when used in Java. An optimizing JRE may assign a reference to the baz variable before it creates the object the reference is intended to point to. For more details refer to: http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2001/jw-0209-double.html
:The double check pattern impacts reliability, since the code may produce a crash or unpredictable behaviour when the half-defined class is used.

* DMI: Don't use removeAll to clear a collection  (DMI_USING_REMOVEALL_TO_CLEAR_COLLECTION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:If you want to remove all elements from a collection <code>c</code>, use <code>c.clear</code>, not <code>c.removeAll(c)</code>. Calling  <code>c.removeAll(c)</code> to clear a collection is less clear, susceptible to errors from typos, less efficient and for some collections, might throw a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code>. 

* FS: Format string placeholder incompatible with passed argument  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_ARGUMENT)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 1
** Description:
:The format string placeholder is incompatible with the corresponding argument. For example, <code> System.out.println("%d
", "hello"); </code> The %d placeholder requires a numeric argument, but a string value is passed instead. A runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since the pattern will throw an exception when executed.

* MS: Field isn't final but should be  (MS_SHOULD_BE_FINAL)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This static field is public but not final, and could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. The field could be made final to avoid this vulnerability.

* SF: Dead store due to switch statement fall through  (SF_DEAD_STORE_DUE_TO_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value stored in the previous switch case is overwritten here due to a switch fall through. It is likely that you forgot to put a break or return at the end of the previous case. 

* XSS: Servlet reflected cross site scripting vulnerability in error page  (XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SEND_ERROR)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to a Server error page (using HttpServletResponse.sendError). Echoing this untrusted input allows for a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting</a> for more information.
:FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of cross site scripting. If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more cross site scripting vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about cross site scripting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

* IIO: Inefficient use of String.lastIndexOf(String) (IIO_INEFFICIENT_LAST_INDEX_OF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code passes a constant string of length 1 to String.lastIndexOf(). It is more efficient to use the integer implementations of String.lastIndexOf(). f. e. call <code>myString.lastIndexOf('.')</code> instead of <code>myString.lastIndexOf(".")</code>

* Field Declarations Should Be At Start Of Class (FieldDeclarationsShouldBeAtStartOfClass)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Fields should be declared at the top of the class, before any method declarations, constructors, initializers or inner classes. 
:This rule impacts analysability, since most people will assume that all declarations are done at the start of the class.

* BC: Questionable cast to abstract collection   (BC_BAD_CAST_TO_ABSTRACT_COLLECTION)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This code casts a Collection to an abstract collection (such as <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, or <code>Map</code>). Ensure that you are guaranteed that the object is of the type you are casting to. If all you need is to be able to iterate through a collection, you don't need to cast it to a Set or List. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since an exception may be thrown if the type cannot be cast.

* Missing Break In Switch (MissingBreakInSwitch)
** Category: REL CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Switch statements without break or return statements for each case option may indicate problematic behaviour. Empty cases are ignored as these indicate an intentional fall-through.
:This rule impacts reliability, since an unpredictable behaviour may arise when unintendedly falling through the next case. It also impacts changeability, since introducing a new case may modify the behaviour of the previous one.

* SA: Self comparison of value with itself  (SA_LOCAL_SELF_COMPARISON)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method compares a local variable with itself, and may indicate a typo or a logic error.  Make sure that you are comparing the right things. 

* RE: Invalid syntax for regular expression  (RE_BAD_SYNTAX_FOR_REGULAR_EXPRESSION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code here uses a regular expression that is invalid according to the syntax for regular expressions. This statement will throw a PatternSyntaxException when executed. 

* BigInteger Instantiation (BigIntegerInstantiation)
** Category: 
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Don't create instances of already existing BigInteger (BigInteger.ZERO, BigInteger.ONE) and for Java 1.5 onwards, BigInteger.TEN and BigDecimal (BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal.ONE, BigDecimal.TEN).
:

* Wa: Condition.await() not in loop (WA_AWAIT_NOT_IN_LOOP)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a call to <code>java.util.concurrent.await()</code> (or variants) which is not in a loop. If the object is used for multiple conditions, the condition the caller intended to wait for might not be the one that actually occurred.

* Excessive Imports (ExcessiveImports)
** Category: REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A high number of imports can indicate a high degree of coupling within an object. This rule counts the number of unique imports and reports a violation if the count is above the user-specified threshold. The default value is set to 30.
:ExcessiveImports attempts to count all unique imports a class contains. This rule will count a <code>import com.something.*;</code> as a single import.
:This rule impacts reusability, since many classes need to be available for this class to work.

* ClassCastException With toArray (ClassCastExceptionWithToArray)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:When deriving an array of a specific class from your Collection, one should provide an array of the same class as the parameter of the toArray() method. Doing otherwise would result in a ClassCastException.
:This pattern impacts the reliability, since an exception may be thrown.

* NP: Null pointer dereference  (NP_ALWAYS_NULL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A null pointer is dereferenced here. This will lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed.

* RC: Suspicious reference comparison to constant  (RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method compares a reference value to a constant using the == or != operator, where the correct way to compare instances of this type is generally with the equals() method. It is possible to create distinct instances that are equal but do not compare as == since they are different objects. Examples of classes which should generally not be compared by reference are java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Float, etc.

* Dm: Consider using Locale parameterized version of invoked method  (DM_CONVERT_CASE)
** Category: REU POR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A String is being converted to upper or lowercase, using the platform's default encoding. This may result in improper conversions when used with international characters. Use the <code>String.toUpperCase( Locale l )</code> and <code>String.toLowerCase( Locale l )</code> versions instead.
:This rule impacts reusability, since people with different charsets may have problems. It also impacts portability, since another platform may have a different encoding.

* IS: Field not guarded against concurrent access  (IS_FIELD_NOT_GUARDED)
** Category: COR THR
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This field is annotated with net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy or javax.annotation.concurrent.GuardedBy, but can be accessed in a way that seems to violate those annotations.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the fields may be accessed inconsistently. It may produce false positives.

* BIT: Bitwise OR of signed byte value  (BIT_IOR_OF_SIGNED_BYTE)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Loads a byte value (e.g., a value loaded from a byte array or returned by a method with return type byte)  and performs a bitwise OR with that value. Byte values are sign extended to 32 bits before any any bitwise operations are performed on the value. Thus, if <code>b[0]</code> contains the value <code>0xff</code>, and <code>x</code> is initially 0, then the code <code>((x &lt;&lt; 8) | b[0])</code>  will sign extend <code>0xff</code> to get <code>0xffffffff</code>, and thus give the value <code>0xffffffff</code> as the result. 
:In particular, the following code for packing a byte array into an int is badly wrong: <pre>int result = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) result = ((result << 8) | b[i]);</pre>
:The following idiom will work instead: <pre>int result = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) result = ((result << 8) | (b[i] & 0xff));</pre>.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* EC: Using pointer equality to compare different types  (EC_UNRELATED_TYPES_USING_POINTER_EQUALITY)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This method uses pointer equality to compare two references that seem to be of different types.  The result of this comparison will always be false at runtime. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it is useless and unnecessary code. 

* NP: toString method may return null  (NP_TOSTRING_COULD_RETURN_NULL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This toString method seems to return null in some circumstances. A liberal reading of the spec could be interpreted as allowing this, but it is probably a bad idea and could cause other code to break. Return the empty string or some other appropriate string rather than null. 

* Se: serialVersionUID isn't long (SE_NONLONG_SERIALVERSIONID)
** Category: COR REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This class defines a <code>serialVersionUID</code> field that is not long. The field should be made long if it is intended to specify the version UID for purposes of serialization.
:This rule impact correctness, since ID problems may arise when serialising and deserialising objects. It also impacts reliability, since an exception may be thrown at runtime when deserialising the object.

* Empty Synchronized Block (EmptySynchronizedBlock)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Empty synchronized blocks serve no purpose and should be removed.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.

* DLS: Dead store to local variable  (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This instruction assigns a value to a local variable, but the value is not read or used in any subsequent instruction. Often, this indicates an error, because the value computed is never used. 
:Note that Sun's javac compiler often generates dead stores for final local variables.  Because FindBugs is a bytecode-based tool, there is no easy way to eliminate these false positives.

* IM: Integer multiply of result of integer remainder  (IM_MULTIPLYING_RESULT_OF_IREM)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code multiplies the result of an integer remaining by an integer constant. Be sure you don't have your operator precedence confused. For example i % 60 * 1000 is (i % 60) * 1000, not i % (60 * 1000). 

* BIT: Check for sign of bitwise operation  (BIT_SIGNED_CHECK)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method compares an expression such as <pre>((event.detail &amp; SWT.SELECTED) &gt; 0)</pre>. Using bit arithmetic and then comparing with the greater than operator can lead to unexpected results (of course depending on the value of SWT.SELECTED). If SWT.SELECTED is a negative number, this is a candidate for a bug. Even when SWT.SELECTED is not negative, it seems good practice to use "!= 0" instead of "&gt; 0". 

* MS: Field is a mutable Hashtable  (MS_MUTABLE_HASHTABLE)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A final static field references a Hashtable and can be accessed by malicious code or by accident from another package. This code can freely modify the contents of the Hashtable.

* Avoid Branching Statement As Last In Loop (AvoidBranchingStatementAsLastInLoop)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:Using a branching statement as the last part of a loop may be a bug, and/or is confusing. Ensure that the usage is not a bug, or consider using another approach.
:This pattern impacts analysability, since the maintainer will have trouble understanding the intended behaviour.

* Nm: Method doesn't override method in superclass due to wrong package for parameter  (NM_WRONG_PACKAGE_INTENTIONAL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The method in the subclass doesn't override a similar method in a superclass because the type of a parameter doesn't exactly match the type of the corresponding parameter in the superclass. For example, if you have: import alpha.Foo; public class A {   public int f(Foo x) { return 17; } } --- import beta.Foo; public class B extends A { public int f(Foo x) { return 42; } public int f(alpha.Foo x) { return 27; } }</pre>.
:The <code>f(Foo)</code> method defined in class <code>B</code> doesn't override the <code>f(Foo)</code> method defined in class A, because the argument types are Foo's from different packages. In this case, the subclass does define a method with a signature identical to the method in the superclass, so this is presumably understood. However, such methods are exceptionally confusing. You should strongly consider removing or deprecating the method with the similar but not identical signature. 

* Unused Modifier (UnusedModifier)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Fields in interfaces are automatically public static final, and methods are public abstract. Classes or interfaces nested in an interface are automatically public and static (all nested interfaces are automatically static). For historical reasons, modifiers which are implied by the context are accepted by the compiler, but are superfluous.
:TODO: The rule's priority could be lowered.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.

* MS: Field should be package protected  (MS_PKGPROTECT)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A mutable static field could be changed by malicious code or by accident. The field could be made package protected to avoid this vulnerability.

* Dm: Method invokes System.exit(...) (DM_EXIT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Invoking System.exit shuts down the entire Java virtual machine. This should only been done when it is appropriate. Such calls make it hard or impossible for your code to be invoked by other code. Consider throwing a RuntimeException instead.

* Avoid Decimal Literals In BigDecimal Constructor (AvoidDecimalLiteralsInBigDecimalConstructor)
** Category: REL CHA
** Priority: 
** Description:
:One might assume that the result of 'new BigDecimal(0.1)' is exactly equal to 0.1, but it is actually equal to .1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. This is because 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a double (or as a binary fraction of any finite length). Thus, the long value that is being passed in to the constructor is not exactly equal to 0.1, appearances notwithstanding. The (String) constructor, on the other hand, is perfectly predictable: 'new BigDecimal('0.1')' is exactly equal to 0.1, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally recommended that the (String) constructor be used in preference to this one.
:This rule impacts product reliability, since the actual number is not the one intended and precision errors may arise.

* GC: Unchecked type in generic call  (GC_UNCHECKED_TYPE_IN_GENERIC_CALL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This call to a generic collection method passes an argument while compile type Object where a specific type from the generic type parameters is expected. Thus, neither the standard Java type system nor static analysis can provide useful information on whether the object being passed as a parameter is of an appropriate type. 

* FE: Test for floating point equality  (FE_FLOATING_POINT_EQUALITY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This operation compares two floating point values for equality. Because floating point calculations may involve rounding, calculated float and double values may not be accurate. For values that must be precise, such as monetary values, consider using a fixed-precision type such as BigDecimal. For values that need not be precise, consider comparing for equality within some range, for example: <code>if ( Math.abs(x - y) &lt; .0000001 )</code>. See the Java Language Specification, section 4.2.4. 

* DMI: Vacuous call to collections  (DMI_VACUOUS_SELF_COLLECTION_CALL)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This call doesn't make sense. For any collection <code>c</code>, calling <code>c.containsAll(c)</code> should always be true, and <code>c.retainAll(c)</code> should have no effect. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* MS: Field isn't final but should be refactored to be so  (MS_SHOULD_BE_REFACTORED_TO_BE_FINAL)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 5
** Description:
:This static field is public but not final, and could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. The field could be made final to avoid this vulnerability. However, the static initializer contains more than one write to the field, so doing so will require some refactoring. 

* USM: Abstract Method is already defined in implemented interface  (USM_USELESS_ABSTRACT_METHOD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This abstract method is already defined in an interface that is implemented by this abstract class. This method can be removed, as it provides no additional value. 

* MS: Public static method may expose internal representation by returning array  (MS_EXPOSE_REP)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A public static method returns a reference to an array that is part of the static state of the class. Any code that calls this method can freely modify the underlying array. One fix is to return a copy of the array.

* Dm: A thread was created using the default empty run method  (DM_USELESS_THREAD)
** Category: EFF THR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This method creates a thread without specifying a run method either by deriving from the Thread class, or by passing a Runnable object. This thread, then, does nothing but waste time. 
:This rule impacts efficiency, since the thread cannot be executed and unncessarily uses resources.

* Nm: Use of identifier that is a keyword in later versions of Java  (NM_FUTURE_KEYWORD_USED_AS_IDENTIFIER)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The identifier is a word that is reserved as a keyword in later versions of Java, and your code will need to be changed in order to compile it in later versions of Java.

* VR: Class makes reference to unresolvable class or method  (VR_UNRESOLVABLE_REFERENCE)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 5
** Description:
:This class makes a reference to a class or method that can not be resolved against the libraries it is being analyzed with. 

* HE: Class defines equals() but not hashCode() (HE_EQUALS_NO_HASHCODE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class overrides <code>equals(Object)</code>, but does not override <code>hashCode()</code>. Therefore, the class may violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.

* Nm: Method names should start with a lower case letter  (NM_METHOD_NAMING_CONVENTION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase, with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. 

* RE: File.separator used for regular expression  (RE_CANT_USE_FILE_SEPARATOR_AS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code here uses <code>File.separator</code> where a regular expression is required. This will fail on Windows platforms, where the <code>File.separator</code> is a backslash, which is interpreted in a regular expression as an escape character. Amoung other options, you can just use <code>File.separatorChar=='\' ? "\\" : File.separator</code> instead of <code>File.separator</code> 

* DMI: Collections should not contain themselves  (DMI_COLLECTIONS_SHOULD_NOT_CONTAIN_THEMSELVES)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This call to a generic collection's method would only make sense if a collection contained itself (e.g., if <code>s.contains(s)</code> were true). This is unlikely to be true and would cause problems if it were true (such as the computation of the hash code resulting in infinite recursion). It is likely that the wrong value is being passed as a parameter. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* BSHIFT: Unsigned right shift cast to short/byte  (ICAST_QUESTIONABLE_UNSIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code performs an unsigned right shift, whose result is then cast to a short or byte, which discards the upper bits of the result. Since the upper bits are discarded, there may be no difference between a signed and unsigned right shift (depending upon the size of the shift). 

* JLM: Synchronization performed on Lock  (JLM_JSR166_LOCK_MONITORENTER)
** Category: COR THR
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This method performs synchronization an object that implements java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock. Such an object is locked/unlocked using <code>acquire()</code>/<code>release()</code> rather than using the <code>synchronized (...)</code> construct. 

* MS: Field isn't final and can't be protected from malicious code  (MS_CANNOT_BE_FINAL)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:A mutable static field could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. Unfortunately, the way the field is used doesn't allow any easy fix to this problem.

* Eq: equals method always returns false  (EQ_ALWAYS_FALSE)
** Category: COR REU
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This class defines an equals method that always returns false. This means that an object is not equal to itself, and it is impossible to create useful Maps or Sets of this class. More fundamentally, it means that equals is not reflexive, one of the requirements of the equals method.
:The likely intended semantics are object identity: that an object is equal to itself. This is the behavior inherited from class Object. If you need to override an equals inherited from a different superclass, you can use use: <pre>public boolean equals(Object o) { return this == o; }</pre>
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since the reflexive requirement is not met and other developers will assume it is.

* ICAST: Integral division result cast to double or float  (ICAST_IDIV_CAST_TO_DOUBLE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code casts the result of an integral division (e.g., int or long division) operation to double or float. Doing division on integers truncates the result to the integer value closest to zero.  The fact that the result was cast to double suggests that this precision should have been retained. What was probably meant was to cast one or both of the operands to double <em>before</em> performing the division.  Here is an example: <pre>int x = 2; int y = 5; /* Wrong: yields result 0.0 */ double value1 =  x / y; /* Right: yields result 0.4 */ double value2 =  x / (double) y;</pre>

* Immutable Field (ImmutableField)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Identifies private fields whose values never change once they are initialized either in the declaration of the field or by a constructor. This helps in converting existing classes to becoming immutable ones.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it will help the maintainer understand the variable is not supposed to change.

* TQ: Comparing values with incompatible type qualifiers  (TQ_COMPARING_VALUES_WITH_INCOMPATIBLE_TYPE_QUALIFIERS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value specified as carrying a type qualifier annotation is compared with a value that doesn't ever carry that qualifier.
:More precisely, a value annotated with a type qualifier specifying when=ALWAYS is compared with a value that where the same type qualifier specifies when=NEVER. For example, say that @NonNegative is a nickname for the type qualifier annotation @Negative(when=When.NEVER). The following code will generate this warning because the return statement requires a @NonNegative value, but receives one that is marked as @Negative. <pre>public boolean example(@Negative Integer value1, @NonNegative Integer value2) { return value1.equals(value2); }</pre>

* DMI: Invocation of hashCode on an array  (DMI_INVOKING_HASHCODE_ON_ARRAY)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:The code invokes hashCode on an array. Calling hashCode on an array returns the same value as System.identityHashCode, and ignores the contents and length of the array. If you need a hashCode that depends on the contents of an array <code>a</code>, use <code>java.util.Arrays.hashCode(a)</code>. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* Eq: Class doesn't override equals in superclass  (EQ_DOESNT_OVERRIDE_EQUALS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class extends a class that defines an equals method and adds fields, but doesn't define an equals method itself. Thus, equality on instances of this class will ignore the identity of the subclass and the added fields. Be sure this is what is intended, and that you don't need to override the equals method. Even if you don't need to override the equals method, consider overriding it anyway to document the fact that the equals method for the subclass just return the result of invoking super.equals(o). 

* Nm: Confusing method names  (NM_CONFUSING)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization.

* ES: Comparison of String objects using == or !=  (ES_COMPARING_STRINGS_WITH_EQ)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code compares <code>java.lang.String</code> objects for reference equality using the == or != operators. Unless both strings are either constants in a source file, or have been interned using the <code>String.intern()</code> method, the same string value may be represented by two different String objects. Consider using the <code>equals(Object)</code> method instead.

* Dm: Futile attempt to change max pool size of ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor  (DMI_FUTILE_ATTEMPT_TO_CHANGE_MAXPOOL_SIZE_OF_SCHEDULED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR)
** Category: COR CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:(<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html">Javadoc</a>) While ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor inherits from ThreadPoolExecutor, a few of the inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In particular, because it acts as a fixed-sized pool using corePoolSize threads and an unbounded queue, adjustments to maximumPoolSize have no useful effect. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts changeability, since a maintainer might try to change the pool size without effect.

* NP: Method call passes null to a nonnull parameter   (NP_NONNULL_PARAM_VIOLATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method passes a null value as the parameter of a method which must be nonnull. Either this parameter has been explicitly marked as @Nonnull, or analysis has determined that this parameter is always dereferenced. 

* NP: Possible null pointer dereference  (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:There is a branch of statement that, <em>if executed,</em>  guarantees that a null value will be dereferenced, which would generate a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed. Of course, the problem might be that the branch or statement is infeasible and that the null pointer exception can't ever be executed; deciding that is beyond the ability of FindBugs. 

* Avoid Constants Interface (AvoidConstantsInterface)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:An interface should be used only to characterize the external behaviour of an implementing class: using an interface as a container of constants is a poor usage pattern and not recommended.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the maintainer may have trouble understanding why the class is declared as an interface.

* SIC: Deadly embrace of non-static inner class and thread local  (SIC_THREADLOCAL_DEADLY_EMBRACE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class is an inner class, but should probably be a static inner class. As it is, there is a serious danger of a deadly embrace between the inner class and the thread local in the outer class. Because the inner class isn't static, it retains a reference to the outer class. If the thread local contains a reference to an instance of the inner class, the inner and outer instance will both be reachable and not eligible for garbage collection. 

* BC: instanceof will always return true  (BC_VACUOUS_INSTANCEOF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This instanceof test will always return true (unless the value being tested is null). Although this is safe, make sure it isn't an indication of some misunderstanding or some other logic error. If you really want to test the value for being null, perhaps it would be clearer to do better to do a null test rather than an instanceof test. 

* Dm: Call to unsupported method  (DMI_UNSUPPORTED_METHOD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:All targets of this method invocation throw an UnsupportedOperationException. 

* Nm: Method doesn't override method in superclass due to wrong package for parameter  (NM_WRONG_PACKAGE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The method in the subclass doesn't override a similar method in a superclass because the type of a parameter doesn't exactly match the type of the corresponding parameter in the superclass. For example, if you have:<pre>import alpha.Foo; public class A { public int f(Foo x) { return 17; } } ---- import beta.Foo; public class B extends A { public int f(Foo x) { return 42; } }</pre>
:The f(Foo) method defined in class B doesn't override the f(Foo) method defined in class A, because the argument types are Foo's from different packages.

* DE: Method might drop exception  (DE_MIGHT_DROP)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method might drop an exception. In general, exceptions should be handled or reported in some way, or they should be thrown out of the method.

* Uncommented Empty Method (UncommentedEmptyMethod)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Uncommented Empty Method finds instances where a method does not contain statements, but there is no comment. By explicitly commenting empty methods it is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented) and unintentional empty methods.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the maintainer does not know if the empty method was really intended and useful.

* Empty Initializer (EmptyInitializer)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Empty block statements serve no purpose and should be removed.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.

* FI: Finalizer does not call superclass finalizer (FI_MISSING_SUPER_CALL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This <code>finalize()</code> method does not make a call to its superclass's <code>finalize()</code> method. So, any finalizer actions defined for the superclass will not be performed. Add a call to <code>super.finalize()</code>.

* Unused Formal Parameter (UnusedFormalParameter)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid passing parameters to methods or constructors without actually referencing them in the method body.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the maintainer will not understand why this parameter is declared.

* NP: Method with Boolean return type returns explicit null  (NP_BOOLEAN_RETURN_NULL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A method that returns either Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE or null is an accident waiting to happen. This method can be invoked as though it returned a value of type boolean, and the compiler will insert automatic unboxing of the Boolean value. If a null value is returned, this will result in a NullPointerException. 

* BC: Unchecked/unconfirmed cast  (BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This cast is unchecked, and not all instances of the type casted from can be cast to the type it is being cast to. Check that your program logic ensures that this cast will not fail. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since an exception may be thrown if the type cannot be cast.

* NP: Dereference of the result of readLine() without nullcheck (NP_DEREFERENCE_OF_READLINE_VALUE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The result of invoking readLine() is dereferenced without checking to see if the result is null. If there are no more lines of text to read, readLine() will return null and dereferencing that will generate a null pointer exception. 

* Avoid Synchronized At Method Level (AvoidSynchronizedAtMethodLevel)
** Category: EFF CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Method-level synchronization can cause problems when new code is added to the method. Block-level synchronization helps to ensure that only the code that needs synchronization gets it.
:This rule impacts resources, since unnecessarily synchronised code will cluter threads queue. It also impacts changeability, since the maintainer will need to refactor the method to add unsynchronised code.

* UI: Usage of GetResource may be unsafe if class is extended  (UI_INHERITANCE_UNSAFE_GETRESOURCE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Calling <code>this.getClass().getResource(...)</code> could give results other than expected if this class is extended by a class in another package.

* VO: A volatile reference to an array doesn't treat the array elements as volatile  (VO_VOLATILE_REFERENCE_TO_ARRAY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This declares a volatile reference to an array, which might not be what you want. With a volatile reference to an array, reads and writes of the reference to the array are treated as volatile, but the array elements are non-volatile. To get volatile array elements, you will need to use one of the atomic array classes in java.util.concurrent (provided in Java 5.0).

* MS: Field is a mutable array  (MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A final static field references an array and can be accessed by malicious code or by accident from another package. This code can freely modify the contents of the array.

* Bx: Primitive value is unboxed and coerced for ternary operator  (BX_UNBOXED_AND_COERCED_FOR_TERNARY_OPERATOR)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A wrapped primitive value is unboxed and converted to another primitive type as part of the evaluation of a conditional ternary operator (the <code> b ? e1 : e2</code> operator). The semantics of Java mandate that if <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code> are wrapped numeric values, the values are unboxed and converted/coerced to their common type (e.g, if <code>e1</code> is of type <code>Integer</code> and <code>e2</code> is of type <code>Float</code>, then <code>e1</code> is unboxed, converted to a floating point value, and boxed. See JLS Section 15.25. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* RS: Class's readObject() method is synchronized (RS_READOBJECT_SYNC)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This serializable class defines a <code>readObject()</code> which is synchronized. By definition, an object created by deserialization is only reachable by one thread, and thus there is no need for <code>readObject()</code> to be synchronized. If the <code>readObject()</code> method itself is causing the object to become visible to another thread, that is an example of very dubious coding style.

* NP: Read of unwritten field (NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The program is dereferencing a field that does not seem to ever have a non-null value written to it. Unless the field is initialized via some mechanism not seen by the analysis, dereferencing this value will generate a null pointer exception.

* CN: clone method does not call super.clone (CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This non-final class defines a clone() method that does not call super.clone(). If this class ("<i>A</i>") is extended by a subclass ("<i>B</i>"), and the subclass <i>B</i> calls super.clone(), then it is likely that <i>B</i>'s clone() method will return an object of type <i>A</i>, which violates the standard contract for clone(). If all clone() methods call super.clone(), then they are guaranteed to use Object.clone(), which always returns an object of the correct type.

* Compare Objects With Equals (CompareObjectsWithEquals)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Use equals() to compare object references; avoid comparing them with ==.
:This rule impacts reliability, since the == operator is not consistent over all types of objects and an exception may arise.
:TODO: This rule also includes Enum's, which is wrong -- comparing Enums with equal might even considered good practice. See http://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/909/

* TQ: Value required to have type qualifier, but marked as unknown  (TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_ALWAYS_SINK)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value is used in a way that requires it to be always be a value denoted by a type qualifier, but there is an explicit annotation stating that it is not known where the value is required to have that type qualifier. Either the usage or the annotation is incorrect. 

* Use Locale With Case Conversions (UseLocaleWithCaseConversions)
** Category: EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:When doing <code>String.toLowerCase()</code>/<code>toUpperCase()</code> conversions, use Locales to avoids problems with languages that have unusual conventions, i.e. Turkish.
:This rule impacts reliability, since it may produce an unpredictable behaviour for different locales.

* UwF: Field only ever set to null  (UWF_NULL_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:All writes to this field are of the constant value null, and thus all reads of the field will return null. Check for errors, or remove it if it is useless.

* SP: Method spins on field  (SP_SPIN_ON_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method spins in a loop which reads a field. The compiler may legally hoist the read out of the loop, turning the code into an infinite loop. The class should be changed so it uses proper synchronization (including wait and notify calls).

* Dm: Method invokes toString() method on a String (DM_STRING_TOSTRING)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Calling <code>String.toString()</code> is just a redundant operation. Just use the String.

* Avoid Reassigning Parameters (AvoidReassigningParameters)
** Category: CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Reassigning values to incoming parameters is not recommended. Use temporary local variables instead.
:This rule impacts changeability, since the maintainer may assume that the parameters contain the passed values.

* SC: Constructor invokes Thread.start() (SC_START_IN_CTOR)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The constructor starts a thread. This is likely to be wrong if the class is ever extended/subclassed, since the thread will be started before the subclass constructor is started.

* IJU: TestCase has no tests  (IJU_NO_TESTS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Class is a JUnit TestCase but has not implemented any test methods

* Eq: equals method fails for subtypes (EQ_GETCLASS_AND_CLASS_CONSTANT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class has an equals method that will be broken if it is inherited by subclasses. It compares a class literal with the class of the argument (e.g., in class <code>Foo</code> it might check if <code>Foo.class == o.getClass()</code>). It is better to check if <code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code>.

* DMI: Random object created and used only once  (DMI_RANDOM_USED_ONLY_ONCE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code creates a java.util.Random object, uses it to generate one random number, and then discards the Random object. This produces mediocre quality random numbers and is inefficient. If possible, rewrite the code so that the Random object is created once and saved, and each time a new random number is required invoke a method on the existing Random object to obtain it. 
:If it is important that the generated Random numbers not be guessable, you must not create a new Random for each random number; the values are too easily guessable. You should strongly consider using a java.security.SecureRandom instead (and avoid allocating a new SecureRandom for each random number needed).

* SA: Nonsensical self computation involving a variable  (SA_LOCAL_SELF_COMPUTATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method performs a nonsensical computation of a local variable with another reference to the same variable (e.g., x&x or x-x). Because of the nature of the computation, this operation doesn't seem to make sense, and may indicate a typo or a logic error.  Double check the computation. 

* Nm: Class defines tostring(); should it be toString()? (NM_LCASE_TOSTRING)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a method called <code>tostring()</code>. This method does not override the <code>toString()</code> method in <code>java.lang.Object</code>, which is probably what was intended.

* FI: Empty finalizer should be deleted  (FI_EMPTY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Empty <code>finalize()</code> methods are useless, so they should be deleted.

* Optimizable toArray Call (OptimizableToArrayCall)
** Category: EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Calls to a collection's toArray() method should specify target arrays sized to match the size of the collection. Initial arrays that are too small are discarded in favour of new ones that have to be created that are the proper size.
:This rule impacts resources, since the array will have to be discarded and recreated at the right size when it is populated.

* DMI: D'oh! A nonsensical method invocation  (DMI_DOH)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This partical method invocation doesn't make sense, for reasons that should be apparent from inspection. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* Se: serialVersionUID isn't static  (SE_NONSTATIC_SERIALVERSIONID)
** Category: COR REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This class defines a <code>serialVersionUID</code> field that is not static. The field should be made static if it is intended to specify the version UID for purposes of serialization.
:This rule impact correctness, since ID problems may arise when serialising and deserialising objects. It also impacts reliability, since an exception may be thrown at runtime when deserialising the object.

* EC: Call to equals(null) (EC_NULL_ARG)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This method calls equals(Object), passing a null value as the argument. According to the contract of the equals() method, this call should always return <code>false</code>.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it is useless and unnecessary code.

* ST: Write to static field from instance method  (ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This instance method writes to a static field. This is tricky to get correct if multiple instances are being manipulated, and generally bad practice. 

* BC: Equals method should not assume anything about the type of its argument  (BC_EQUALS_METHOD_SHOULD_WORK_FOR_ALL_OBJECTS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The <code>equals(Object o)</code> method shouldn't make any assumptions about the type of <code>o</code>. It should simply return false if <code>o</code> is not the same type as <code>this</code>. 

* EC: Call to equals() comparing different interface types (EC_UNRELATED_INTERFACES)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This method calls equals(Object) on two references of unrelated interface types, where neither is a subtype of the other, and there are no known non-abstract classes which implement both interfaces. Therefore, the objects being compared are unlikely to be members of the same class at runtime (unless some application classes were not analyzed, or dynamic class loading can occur at runtime). According to the contract of equals(), objects of different classes should always compare as unequal; therefore, according to the contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals(Object), the result of this comparison will always be false at runtime. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it is useless and unnecessary code. This may produce false positives if a class is missing in the analysis.

* UL: Method does not release lock on all paths  (UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method acquires a JSR-166 (<code>java.util.concurrent</code>) lock, but does not release it on all paths out of the method.  In general, the correct idiom for using a JSR-166 lock is: <pre>Lock l = ...; l.lock(); try { /* do something */ } finally { l.unlock(); }</pre>

* Dm: Explicit garbage collection; extremely dubious except in benchmarking code  (DM_GC)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Code explicitly invokes garbage collection. Except for specific use in benchmarking, this is very dubious. In the past, situations where people have explicitly invoked the garbage collector in routines such as close or finalize methods has led to huge performance black holes. Garbage collection can be expensive. Any situation that forces hundreds or thousands of garbage collections will bring the machine to a crawl.

* OBL: Method may fail to clean up stream or resource on checked exception  (OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION_EXCEPTION_EDGE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method may fail to clean up (close, dispose of) a stream, database object, or other resource requiring an explicit cleanup operation.  In general, if a method opens a stream or other resource, the method should use a try/finally block to ensure that the stream or resource is cleaned up before the method returns.
:This bug pattern is essentially the same as the OS_OPEN_STREAM and ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE bug patterns, but is based on a different (and hopefully better) static analysis technique. See Weimer and Necula, <em>Finding and Preventing Run-Time Error Handling Mistakes</em>, for a description of the analysis technique. 

* RCN: Redundant comparison of non-null value to null  (RCN_REDUNDANT_COMPARISON_OF_NULL_AND_NONNULL_VALUE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a reference known to be non-null with another reference known to be null.

* DMI: BigDecimal constructed from double that isn't represented precisely  (DMI_BIGDECIMAL_CONSTRUCTED_FROM_DOUBLE)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This code creates a BigDecimal from a double value that doesn't translate well to a decimal number. For example, one might assume that writing new BigDecimal(0.1) in Java creates a BigDecimal which is exactly equal to 0.1 (an unscaled value of 1, with a scale of 1), but it is actually equal to 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. You probably want to use the BigDecimal.valueOf(double d) method, which uses the String representation of the double to create the BigDecimal (e.g., BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1) gives 0.1). 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* BIT: Bitwise add of signed byte value  (BIT_ADD_OF_SIGNED_BYTE)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Adds a byte value and a value which is known to have the 8 lower bits clear. Values loaded from a byte array are sign extended to 32 bits before any bitwise operations are performed on the value. Thus, if <code>b[0]</code> contains the value <code>0xff</code>, and <code>x</code> is initially 0, then the code <code>((x &lt;&lt; 8) + b[0])</code>  will sign extend <code>0xff</code> to get <code>0xffffffff</code>, and thus give the value <code>0xffffffff</code> as the result.
:In particular, the following code for packing a byte array into an int is badly wrong:<pre>int result = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) result = ((result << 8) + b[i]);</pre>.
:The following idiom will work instead: <pre>int result = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) result = ((result << 8) + (b[i] & 0xff));</pre>.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* DB: Method uses the same code for two switch clauses  (DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method uses the same code to implement two clauses of a switch statement. This could be a case of duplicate code, but it might also indicate a coding mistake. 

* Nm: Class names should start with an upper case letter  (NM_CLASS_NAMING_CONVENTION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. Try to keep your class names simple and descriptive. Use whole words-avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML). 

* UM: Method calls static Math class method on a constant value  (UM_UNNECESSARY_MATH)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method uses a static method from java.lang.Math on a constant value. This method's result in this case, can be determined statically, and is faster and sometimes more accurate to just use the constant. Methods detected are: abs, acos, asin, atan, atan2, cbrt, ceil, cos, cosh, exp, expm1, floor, log, log10, rint, round, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, tanh, toDegrees, toRadians.

* IJU: TestCase declares a bad suite method (IJU_BAD_SUITE_METHOD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Class is a JUnit TestCase and defines a suite() method. However, the suite method needs to be declared as either <code>public static junit.framework.Test suite()</code> or <code>public static junit.framework.TestSuite suite()</code>.

* Se: The readResolve method must not be declared as a static method (SE_READ_RESOLVE_IS_STATIC)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:In order for the readResolve method to be recognized by the serialization mechanism, it must not be declared as a static method. 

* Nm: Very confusing method names  (NM_VERY_CONFUSING)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization. This is very confusing because if the capitalization were identical then one of the methods would override the other. 

* MTIA: Class extends Struts Action class and uses instance variables  (MTIA_SUSPECT_STRUTS_INSTANCE_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class extends from a Struts Action class, and uses an instance member variable. Since only one instance of a struts Action class is created by the Struts framework, and used in a multithreaded way, this paradigm is highly discouraged and most likely problematic. Consider only using method local variables. Only instance fields that are written outside of a monitor are reported. 

* Nm: Apparent method/constructor confusion  (NM_METHOD_CONSTRUCTOR_CONFUSION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This regular method has the same name as the class it is defined in. It is likely that this was intended to be a constructor. If it was intended to be a constructor, remove the declaration of a void return value. If you had accidently defined this method, realized the mistake, defined a proper constructor but can't get rid of this method due to backwards compatibility, deprecate the method. 

* Eq: equals() method always returns true  (EQ_ALWAYS_TRUE)
** Category: COR REU
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This class defines an equals method that always returns true. This is imaginative, but not very smart. Plus, it means that the equals method is not symmetric. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since the reflexive requirement is not met and other developers will assume it is.

* EC: Call to equals() comparing different types (EC_UNRELATED_TYPES)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This method calls equals(Object) on two references of different class types with no common subclasses. Therefore, the objects being compared are unlikely to be members of the same class at runtime (unless some application classes were not analyzed, or dynamic class loading can occur at runtime). According to the contract of equals(), objects of different classes should always compare as unequal; therefore, according to the contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals(Object), the result of this comparison will always be false at runtime. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it is useless and unnecessary code. This may produce false positives if a class is missing in the analysis.

* RV: Random value from 0 to 1 is coerced to the integer 0  (RV_01_TO_INT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A random value from 0 to 1 is being coerced to the integer value 0. You probably want to multiple the random value by something else before coercing it to an integer, or use the <code>Random.nextInt(n)</code> method. 

* DLS: Overwritten increment  (DLS_OVERWRITTEN_INCREMENT)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The code performs an increment operation (e.g., <code>i++</code>) and then immediately overwrites it. For example, <code>i = i++</code> immediately overwrites the incremented value with the original value. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since a maintainer will wonder why the increment has been added if not used.

* EC: Call to equals() comparing unrelated class and interface  (EC_UNRELATED_CLASS_AND_INTERFACE)
** Category: COR ANA
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This method calls equals(Object) on two references,  one of which is a class and the other an interface, where neither the class nor any of its non-abstract subclasses implement the interface. Therefore, the objects being compared are unlikely to be members of the same class at runtime (unless some application classes were not analyzed, or dynamic class loading can occur at runtime). According to the contract of equals(), objects of different classes should always compare as unequal; therefore, according to the contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals(Object), the result of this comparison will always be false at runtime. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it is useless and unnecessary code. This may produce false positives if a class is missing in the analysis.

* XFB: Method directly allocates a specific implementation of xml interfaces  (XFB_XML_FACTORY_BYPASS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method allocates a specific implementation of an xml interface. It is preferable to use the supplied factory classes to create these objects so that the implementation can be changed at runtime. See <code>javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory</code>, <code>javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory</code>, <code>javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory</code>, <code>org.w3c.dom.Document.create<i>XXXX</i></code> for details.

* Nm: Field names should start with a lower case letter (NM_FIELD_NAMING_CONVENTION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Names of fields that are not final should be in mixed case with a lowercase first letter and the first letters of subsequent words capitalized.

* INT: Bad comparison of signed byte (INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_SIGNED_BYTE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Signed bytes can only have a value in the range -128 to 127. Comparing a signed byte with a value outside that range is vacuous and likely to be incorrect. To convert a signed byte <code>b</code> to an unsigned value in the range 0..255, use <code>0xff &amp; b</code>.

* OBL: Method may fail to clean up stream or resource  (OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method may fail to clean up (close, dispose of) a stream, database object, or other resource requiring an explicit cleanup operation.  In general, if a method opens a stream or other resource, the method should use a try/finally block to ensure that the stream or resource is cleaned up before the method returns.
:This bug pattern is essentially the same as the OS_OPEN_STREAM and ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE bug patterns, but is based on a different (and hopefully better) static analysis technique. See Weimer and Necula, <em>Finding and Preventing Run-Time Error Handling Mistakes</em>, for a description of the analysis technique. 

* RV: Bad attempt to compute absolute value of signed random integer  (RV_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_OF_RANDOM_INT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code generates a random signed integer and then computes the absolute value of that random integer.  If the number returned by the random number generator is <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>, then the result will be negative as well (since <code>Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) == Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>). (Same problem arised for long values as well). 

* RV: Remainder of 32-bit signed random integer  (RV_REM_OF_RANDOM_INT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code generates a random signed integer and then computes the remainder of that value modulo another value. Since the random number can be negative, the result of the remainder operation can also be negative. Be sure this is intended, and strongly consider using the Random.nextInt(int) method instead. 

* RI: Class implements same interface as superclass  (RI_REDUNDANT_INTERFACES)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class declares that it implements an interface that is also implemented by a superclass. This is redundant because once a superclass implements an interface, all subclasses by default also implement this interface. It may point out that the inheritance hierarchy has changed since this class was created, and consideration should be given to the ownership of the interface's implementation. 

* UrF: Unread field  (URF_UNREAD_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This field is never read. Consider removing it from the class.

* Dm: Can't use reflection to check for presence of annotation without runtime retention  (DMI_ANNOTATION_IS_NOT_VISIBLE_TO_REFLECTION)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:Unless an annotation has itself been annotated with  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME), the annotation can't be observed using reflection (e.g., by using the isAnnotationPresent method).
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* UCF: Useless control flow to next line  (UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW_NEXT_LINE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a useless control flow statement in which control flow follows to the same or following line regardless of whether or not the branch is taken. Often, this is caused by inadvertently using an empty statement as the body of an <code>if</code> statement, e.g.: <pre>if (argv.length == 1); System.out.println("Hello, " + argv[0]);</pre>.

* MWN: Mismatched wait() (MWN_MISMATCHED_WAIT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method calls Object.wait() without obviously holding a lock on the object.  Calling wait() without a lock held will result in an <code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code> being thrown.

* Non Static Initializer (NonStaticInitializer)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A non-static initializer block will be called any time a constructor is invoked (just prior to invoking the constructor). While this is a valid language construct, it is rarely used and is confusing.
:This rule impacts analysability, since a maintainer will look for the constructor as the first chunk of code executed.

* Bx: Boxing/unboxing to parse a primitive  (DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_PARSING)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A boxed primitive is created from a String, just to extract the unboxed primitive value. It is more efficient to just call the static parseXXX method.

* ISC: Needless instantiation of class that only supplies static methods  (ISC_INSTANTIATE_STATIC_CLASS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class allocates an object that is based on a class that only supplies static methods. This object does not need to be created, just access the static methods directly using the class name as a qualifier.

* UPM: Private method is never called  (UPM_UNCALLED_PRIVATE_METHOD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This private method is never called. Although it is possible that the method will be invoked through reflection, it is more likely that the method is never used, and should be removed. 

* SA: Self assignment of field  (SA_FIELD_SELF_ASSIGNMENT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a self assignment of a field; e.g. <pre>int x; public void foo() { x = x; }</pre>. Such assignments are useless, and may indicate a logic error or typo.

* AM: Creates an empty zip file entry  (AM_CREATES_EMPTY_ZIP_FILE_ENTRY)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code calls <code>putNextEntry()</code>, immediately followed by a call to <code>closeEntry()</code>. This results in an empty ZipFile entry. The contents of the entry should be written to the ZipFile between the calls to <code>putNextEntry()</code> and <code>closeEntry()</code>.

* RCN: Nullcheck of value previously dereferenced  (RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value is checked here to see whether it is null, but this value can't be null because it was previously dereferenced and if it were null a null pointer exception would have occurred at the earlier dereference. Essentially, this code and the previous dereference disagree as to whether this value is allowed to be null. Either the check is redundant or the previous dereference is erroneous.

* It: Iterator next() method can't throw NoSuchElementException (IT_NO_SUCH_ELEMENT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class implements the <code>java.util.Iterator</code> interface. However, its <code>next()</code> method is not capable of throwing <code>java.util.NoSuchElementException</code>. The <code>next()</code> method should be changed so it throws <code>NoSuchElementException</code> if is called when there are no more elements to return.

* NP: Immediate dereference of the result of readLine() (NP_IMMEDIATE_DEREFERENCE_OF_READLINE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The result of invoking readLine() is immediately dereferenced. If there are no more lines of text to read, readLine() will return null and dereferencing that will generate a null pointer exception. 

* SIC: Could be refactored into a static inner class  (SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_NEEDS_THIS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference to the object which created it except during construction of the inner object. This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary. If possible, the class should be made into a <em>static</em> inner class. Since the reference to the outer object is required during construction of the inner instance, the inner class will need to be refactored so as to pass a reference to the outer instance to the constructor for the inner class.

* FI: Finalizer nullifies superclass finalizer (FI_NULLIFY_SUPER)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This empty <code>finalize()</code> method explicitly negates the effect of any finalizer defined by its superclass. Any finalizer actions defined for the superclass will not be performed. Unless this is intended, delete this method.

* DE: Method might ignore exception  (DE_MIGHT_IGNORE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method might ignore an exception. In general, exceptions should be handled or reported in some way, or they should be thrown out of the method.

* NP: Method relaxes nullness annotation on return value  (NP_METHOD_RETURN_RELAXING_ANNOTATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A method should always implement the contract of a method it overrides. Thus, if a method takes is annotated as returning a @Nonnull value, you shouldn't override that method in a subclass with a method annotated as returning a @Nullable or @CheckForNull value. Doing so violates the contract that the method shouldn't return null. 

* TQ: Value annotated as never carrying a type qualifier used where value carrying that qualifier is required  (TQ_NEVER_VALUE_USED_WHERE_ALWAYS_REQUIRED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value specified as not carrying a type qualifier annotation is guaranteed to be consumed in a location or locations requiring that the value does carry that annotation.
:More precisely, a value annotated with a type qualifier specifying when=NEVER is guaranteed to reach a use or uses where the same type qualifier specifies when=ALWAYS.

* Nm: Class names shouldn't shadow simple name of implemented interface  (NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_INTERFACE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class/interface has a simple name that is identical to that of an implemented/extended interface, except that the interface is in a different package (e.g., <code>alpha.Foo</code> extends <code>beta.Foo</code>). This can be exceptionally confusing, create lots of situations in which you have to look at import statements to resolve references and creates many opportunities to accidently define methods that do not override methods in their superclasses. 

* Se: Class is Externalizable but doesn't define a void constructor  (SE_NO_SUITABLE_CONSTRUCTOR_FOR_EXTERNALIZATION)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This class implements the <code>Externalizable</code> interface, but does not define a void constructor. When Externalizable objects are deserialized, they first need to be constructed by invoking the void constructor. Since this class does not have one, serialization and deserialization will fail at runtime.
:This rule impacts reliability, since an exception may be thrown at runtime when deserialising the object.

* Empty Method In Abstract Class Should Be Abstract (EmptyMethodInAbstractClassShouldBeAbstract)
** Category: REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Empty methods in an abstract class should be tagged as abstract. This helps to remove their inapproprate usage by developers who should be implementing their own versions in the concrete subclasses.
:This rule impacts reusability, since it helps inheriting the class correctly.

* Switch Density (SwitchDensity)
** Category: ANA CHA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A high ratio of statements to labels in a switch statement implies that the switch statement is overloaded. Consider moving the statements into new methods or creating subclasses based on the switch variable. The threshold can be configured by the user, default value is 10.
:Switch Density is the number of statements over the number of cases within a switch. The higher the value, the more work each case is doing. When the Switch Density is high, you should start looking at Subclasses or State Pattern to alleviate the problem.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it builds a complex control structure. It also impacts changeability, since it implies a large number of complex paths, which may cause side-effects.

* IM: Computation of average could overflow  (IM_AVERAGE_COMPUTATION_COULD_OVERFLOW)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code computes the average of two integers using either division or signed right shift, and then uses the result as the index of an array. If the values being averaged are very large, this can overflow (resulting in the computation of a negative average).  Assuming that the result is intended to be nonnegative, you can use an unsigned right shift instead. In other words, rather that using <code>(low+high)/2</code>, use <code>(low+high) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1</code>.
:This bug exists in many earlier implementations of binary search and merge sort. Martin Buchholz <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6412541">found and fixed it</a> in the JDK libraries, and Joshua Bloch <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html">widely publicized the bug pattern</a>.

* HE: Class inherits equals() and uses Object.hashCode() (HE_INHERITS_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class inherits <code>equals(Object)</code> from an abstract superclass, and <code>hashCode()</code> from <code>java.lang.Object</code> (which returns the identity hash code, an arbitrary value assigned to the object by the VM). Therefore, the class is very likely to violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.
:If you don't want to define a hashCode method, and/or don't believe the object will ever be put into a HashMap/Hashtable, define the <code>hashCode()</code> method to throw <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>.

* Se: Comparator doesn't implement Serializable  (SE_COMPARATOR_SHOULD_BE_SERIALIZABLE)
** Category: MAT
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This class implements the <code>Comparator</code> interface. You should consider whether or not it should also implement the <code>Serializable</code> interface. If a comparator is used to construct an ordered collection such as a <code>TreeMap</code>, then the <code>TreeMap</code> will be serializable only if the comparator is also serializable. As most comparators have little or no state, making them serializable is generally easy and good defensive programming. 
:This rule impacts maturity, since it helps increase reliability through defensive programming.

* NP: Possible null pointer dereference in method on exception path  (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_EXCEPTION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A reference value which is null on some exception control path is dereferenced here. This may lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed. Note that because FindBugs currently does not prune infeasible exception paths, this may be a false warning.
:Also note that FindBugs considers the default case of a switch statement to be an exception path, since the default case is often infeasible.

* Dm: Reliance on default encoding  (DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING)
** Category: REU POR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Found a call to a method which will perform a byte to String (or String to byte) conversion, and will assume that the default platform encoding is suitable. This will cause the application behaviour to vary between platforms. Use an alternative API and specify a charset name or Charset object explicitly.
:This rule impacts reusability, since people with different charsets may have problems. It also impacts portability, since another platform may have a different encoding.

* ESync: Empty synchronized block  (ESync_EMPTY_SYNC)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The code contains an empty synchronized block:</p> <pre> synchronized() {} </pre> Empty synchronized blocks are far more subtle and hard to use correctly than most people recognize, and empty synchronized blocks are almost never a better solution than less contrived solutions. 

* SBSC: Method concatenates strings using + in a loop  (SBSC_USE_STRINGBUFFER_CONCATENATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The method seems to be building a String using concatenation in a loop. In each iteration, the String is converted to a StringBuffer/StringBuilder, appended to, and converted back to a String. This can lead to a cost quadratic in the number of iterations, as the growing string is recopied in each iteration.
:Better performance can be obtained by using a StringBuffer (or StringBuilder in Java 1.5) explicitly. For example: <pre>/* This is bad */ String s = ""; for (int i = 0; i &lt; field.length; ++i) { s = s + field[i]; }</pre> <pre>/* This is better */ StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; field.length; ++i) { buf.append(field[i]); } String s = buf.toString();</pre>.

* Nm: Class defines hashcode(); should it be hashCode()? (NM_LCASE_HASHCODE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a method called <code>hashcode()</code>. This method does not override the <code>hashCode()</code> method in <code>java.lang.Object</code>, which is probably what was intended.

* Bx: Boxed value is unboxed and then immediately reboxed  (BX_UNBOXING_IMMEDIATELY_REBOXED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A boxed value is unboxed and then immediately reboxed. 

* NP: close() invoked on a value that is always null (NP_CLOSING_NULL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:close() is being invoked on a value that is always null. If this statement is executed, a null pointer exception will occur. But the big risk here you never close something that should be closed.

* Too Few Branches For A Switch Statement (TooFewBranchesForASwitchStatement)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Switch statements are indended to be used to support complex branching behaviour. Using a switch for only a few cases is ill-advised, since switches are not as easy to understand as if-then statements. In these cases use the if-then statement to increase code readability. Default value is 3 and above.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the switch statement is more difficult to read than a simple if-then.

* RC: Suspicious reference comparison of Boolean values  (RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE_BOOLEAN)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method compares two Boolean values using the == or != operator. Normally, there are only two Boolean values (Boolean.TRUE and Boolean.FALSE), but it is possible to create other Boolean objects using the <code>new Boolean(b)</code> constructor. It is best to avoid such objects, but if they do exist, then checking Boolean objects for equality using == or != will give results than are different than you would get using <code>.equals(...)</code> 

* Return Empty Array Rather Than Null (ReturnEmptyArrayRatherThanNull)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:For any method that returns an array, it is a better to return an empty array rather than a null reference. This removes the need for null checking all results and avoids inadvertent NullPointerExceptions. 
:This rule impacts reliability, since a NullPointerException may arise from the method's caller.

* EC: equals() used to compare array and nonarray (EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAY)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:This method invokes the .equals(Object o) to compare an array and a reference that doesn't seem to be an array. If things being compared are of different types, they are guaranteed to be unequal and the comparison is almost certainly an error. Even if they are both arrays, the equals method on arrays only determines of the two arrays are the same object. To compare the contents of the arrays, use java.util.Arrays.equals(Object[], Object[]). 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* IJU: TestCase defines setUp that doesn't call super.setUp() (IJU_SETUP_NO_SUPER)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Class is a JUnit TestCase and implements the setUp method. The setUp method should call super.setUp(), but doesn't.

* Dm: The equals and hashCode methods of URL are blocking  (DMI_BLOCKING_METHODS_ON_URL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The equals and hashCode method of URL perform domain name resolution, this can result in a big performance hit. See <a href="http://michaelscharf.blogspot.com/2006/11/javaneturlequals-and-hashcode-make.html">http://michaelscharf.blogspot.com/2006/11/javaneturlequals-and-hashcode-make.html</a> for more information. Consider using <code>java.net.URI</code> instead. 

* NP: Store of null value into field annotated NonNull  (NP_STORE_INTO_NONNULL_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value that could be null is stored into a field that has been annotated as NonNull.

* STCAL: Static DateFormat  (STCAL_STATIC_SIMPLE_DATE_FORMAT_INSTANCE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:As the JavaDoc states, DateFormats are inherently unsafe for multithreaded use. Sharing a single instance across thread boundaries without proper synchronization will result in erratic behavior of the application.
:You may also experience serialization problems. Using an instance field is recommended.
:For more information on this see <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6231579">Sun Bug #6231579</a> and <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6178997">Sun Bug #6178997</a>.

* STCAL: Static Calendar field  (STCAL_STATIC_CALENDAR_INSTANCE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Even though the JavaDoc does not contain a hint about it, Calendars are inherently unsafe for multihtreaded use. Sharing a single instance across thread boundaries without proper synchronization will result in erratic behavior of the application. Under 1.4 problems seem to surface less often than under Java 5 where you will probably see random ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions or IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions in sun.util.calendar.BaseCalendar.getCalendarDateFromFixedDate().
:You may also experience serialization problems. Using an instance field is recommended.
:For more information on this see <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6231579">Sun Bug #6231579</a> and <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6178997">Sun Bug #6178997</a>.

* STI: Static Thread.interrupted() method invoked on thread instance  (STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_UNKNOWNTHREAD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method invokes the Thread.interrupted() method on a Thread object that appears to be a Thread object that is not the current thread. As the interrupted() method is static, the interrupted method will be called on a different object than the one the author intended. 

* INT: Vacuous bit mask operation on integer value  (INT_VACUOUS_BIT_OPERATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This is an integer bit operation (and, or, or exclusive or) that doesn't do any useful work (e.g., <code>v & 0xffffffff</code>). 

* Eq: equals() method compares class names rather than class objects  (EQ_COMPARING_CLASS_NAMES)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This method checks to see if two objects are the same class by checking to see if the names of their classes are equal. You can have different classes with the same name if they are loaded by different class loaders. Just check to see if the class objects are the same. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* DP: Classloaders should only be created inside doPrivileged block (DP_CREATE_CLASSLOADER_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This code creates a classloader, which needs permission if a security manage is installed. If this code might be invoked by code that does not have security permissions, then the classloader creation needs to occur inside a doPrivileged block.

* Boolean Instantiation (BooleanInstantiation)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:Avoid instantiating Boolean objects; you can reference Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE, or call Boolean.valueOf() instead.
:Boolean instantiation adds unnecessary complexity and clutters the code.

* MF: Method defines a variable that obscures a field  (MF_METHOD_MASKS_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method defines a local variable with the same name as a field in this class or a superclass. This may cause the method to read an uninitialized value from the field, leave the field uninitialized, or both.

* SF: Dead store due to switch statement fall through to throw  (SF_DEAD_STORE_DUE_TO_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH_TO_THROW)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value stored in the previous switch case is ignored here due to a switch fall through to a place where an exception is thrown. It is likely that you forgot to put a break or return at the end of the previous case. 

* SF: Switch statement found where one case falls through to the next case  (SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a switch statement where one case branch will fall through to the next case. Usually you need to end this case with a break or return.

* FS: Format string should use %n rather than 
  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_USES_NEWLINE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This format string includes a newline character (
). In format strings, it is generally preferable better to use %n, which will produce the platform-specific line separator. 

* Return From Finally Block (ReturnFromFinallyBlock)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid returning from a finally block, this can discard exceptions.
:It impacts reliability because the caught exception may hide another unseen exception.

* Eq: Abstract class defines covariant equals (EQ_ABSTRACT_SELF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a covariant version of <code>equals()</code>. To correctly override the <code>equals()</code> method in <code>java.lang.Object</code>, the parameter of <code>equals()</code> must have type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.

* Bx: Method invokes inefficient Number constructor; use static valueOf instead  (DM_NUMBER_CTOR)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Using <code>new Integer(int)</code> is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas <code>Integer.valueOf(int)</code> allows caching of values to be done by the compiler, class library, or JVM. Using of cached values avoids object allocation and the code will be faster. 

* ICAST: Integral value cast to double and then passed to Math.ceil  (ICAST_INT_CAST_TO_DOUBLE_PASSED_TO_CEIL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code converts an integral value (e.g., int or long) to a double precision floating point number and then passing the result to the Math.ceil() function, which rounds a double to the next higher integer value. This operation should always be a no-op, since the converting an integer to a double should give a number with no fractional part. It is likely that the operation that generated the value to be passed to Math.ceil was intended to be performed using double precision floating point arithmetic. 

* BIT: Check to see if ((...) & 0) == 0 (BIT_AND_ZZ)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This method compares an expression of the form (e &amp; 0) to 0, which will always compare equal. This may indicate a logic error or typo.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is probably not what was intended.

* Se: Non-serializable value stored into instance field of a serializable class  (SE_BAD_FIELD_STORE)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 2
** Description:
:A non-serializable value is stored into a non-transient field of a serializable class.
:This rule impacts reliability, since an exception will occur when attempting to serialise the inner class.

* IL: A collection is added to itself  (IL_CONTAINER_ADDED_TO_ITSELF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A collection is added to itself. As a result, computing the hashCode of this set will throw a StackOverflowException. 

* Unnecessary Local Before Return (UnnecessaryLocalBeforeReturn)
** Category: ANA EFF
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid the creation of unnecessary local variables.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code. It also impacts resources, since an unnecessary variable is created.

* HE: Class defines equals() and uses Object.hashCode() (HE_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class overrides <code>equals(Object)</code>, but does not override <code>hashCode()</code>, and inherits the implementation of <code>hashCode()</code> from <code>java.lang.Object</code> (which returns the identity hash code, an arbitrary value assigned to the object by the VM). Therefore, the class is very likely to violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.
:If you don't think instances of this class will ever be inserted into a HashMap/HashTable, the recommended hashCode implementation to use is: <pre>public int hashCode() { assert false : "hashCode not designed"; return 42; /* any arbitrary constant will do */ }</pre>.

* JLM: Using monitor style wait methods on util.concurrent abstraction  (JML_JSR166_CALLING_WAIT_RATHER_THAN_AWAIT)
** Category: CHA THR
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:This method calls <code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code> or <code>notifyAll()()</code> on an object that also provides an <code>await()</code>, <code>signal()</code>, <code>signalAll()</code> method (such as util.concurrent Condition objects). This probably isn't what you want, and even if you do want it, you should consider changing your design, as other developers will find it exceptionally confusing. 
:This rule impacts changeability, since maintainers will be confused by the method names.

* TQ: Value without a type qualifier used where a value is required to have that qualifier  (TQ_UNKNOWN_VALUE_USED_WHERE_ALWAYS_STRICTLY_REQUIRED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A value is being used in a way that requires the value be annotation with a type qualifier. The type qualifier is strict, so the tool rejects any values that do not have the appropriate annotation. To coerce a value to have a strict annotation, define an identity function where the return value is annotated with the strict annotation. This is the only way to turn a non-annotated value into a value with a strict type qualifier annotation. 

* CN: Class defines clone() but doesn't implement Cloneable (CN_IMPLEMENTS_CLONE_BUT_NOT_CLONEABLE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a clone() method but the class doesn't implement Cloneable. There are some situations in which this is OK (e.g., you want to control how subclasses can clone themselves), but just make sure that this is what you intended. 

* INT: Vacuous comparison of integer value  (INT_VACUOUS_COMPARISON)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:There is an integer comparison that always returns the same value (e.g., x &lt;= Integer.MAX_VALUE). 

* NP: A known null value is checked to see if it is an instance of a type  (NP_NULL_INSTANCEOF)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This instanceof test will always return false, since the value being checked is guaranteed to be null. Although this is safe, make sure it isn't an indication of some misunderstanding or some other logic error. 

* FS: More arguments are passed than are actually used in the format string  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS_PASSED)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A format-string method with a variable number of arguments is called, but more arguments are passed than are actually used by the format string. This won't cause a runtime exception, but the code may be silently omitting information that was intended to be included in the formatted string. 
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* Simplify Boolean Expressions (SimplifyBooleanExpressions)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid unnecessary comparisons in boolean expressions, they serve no purpose and impacts readability.
:This rule impacts analysability, since unnecessary code confuses the reader.

* DLS: Dead store to local variable that shadows field  (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_SHADOWS_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This instruction assigns a value to a local variable, but the value is not read or used in any subsequent instruction. Often, this indicates an error, because the value computed is never used. There is a field with the same name as the local variable. Did you mean to assign to that variable instead? 

* ES: Comparison of String parameter using == or !=  (ES_COMPARING_PARAMETER_STRING_WITH_EQ)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code compares a <code>java.lang.String</code> parameter for reference equality using the == or != operators. Requiring callers to pass only String constants or interned strings to a method is unnecessarily fragile, and rarely leads to measurable performance gains. Consider using the <code>equals(Object)</code> method instead.

* FB: Missing expected or desired warning from FindBugs  (FB_MISSING_EXPECTED_WARNING)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 5
** Description:
:FindBugs didn't generate a warning that, according to a @ExpectedWarning annotated, is expected or desired
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* SQL: Nonconstant string passed to execute method on an SQL statement  (SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE)
** Category: EFF SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The method invokes the execute method on an SQL statement with a String that seems to be dynamically generated. Consider using a prepared statement instead. It is more efficient and less vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. 

* NP: Synchronize and null check on the same field.  (NP_SYNC_AND_NULL_CHECK_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Since the field is synchronized on, it seems not likely to be null. If it is null and then synchronized on a NullPointerException will be thrown and the check would be pointless. Better to synchronize on another field.

* ODR: Method may fail to close database resource on exception  (ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE_EXCEPTION_PATH)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The method creates a database resource (such as a database connection or row set), does not assign it to any fields, pass it to other methods, or return it, and does not appear to close the object on all exception paths out of the method. Failure to close database resources on all paths out of a method may result in poor performance, and could cause the application to have problems communicating with the database.

* Simplify Conditional (SimplifyConditional)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:No need to check for null before an instanceof; the instanceof keyword returns false when given a null argument.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the pattern implies unnecessary code.

* Abstract Class Without Abstract Method (AbstractClassWithoutAbstractMethod)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:The abstract class does not contain any abstract methods. An abstract class suggests an incomplete implementation, which is to be completed by subclasses implementing the abstract methods. If the class is intended to be used as a base class only (not to be instantiated directly) a protected constructor can be provided to prevent direct instantiation.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the class is pointless regarding the abstract intent and the maintain will wonder why this class is abstract.

* FS: No previous argument for format string  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_NO_PREVIOUS_ARGUMENT)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 1
** Description:
:The format string specifies a relative index to request that the argument for the previous format specifier be reused. However, there is no previous argument. For example, <code>formatter.format("%&lt;s %s", "a", "b")</code> would throw a <code>MissingFormatArgumentException</code> when executed.
:This rule impacts reliability, since the pattern will throw an exception when executed.

* Idempotent Operations (IdempotentOperations)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Avoid idempotent operations - they have no effect.
:This rule impacts analysis, since it adds unnecessary code.

* Co: compareTo()/compare() returns Integer.MIN_VALUE (CO_COMPARETO_RESULTS_MIN_VALUE)
** Category: COR
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:In some situation, this compareTo or compare method returns the constant Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is an exceptionally bad practice. The only thing that matters about the return value of compareTo is the sign of the result. But people will sometimes negate the return value of compareTo, expecting that this will negate the sign of the result. And it will, except in the case where the value returned is Integer.MIN_VALUE. So just return -1 rather than Integer.MIN_VALUE.
:This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.

* Eq: Covariant equals() method defined (EQ_SELF_NO_OBJECT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a covariant version of <code>equals()</code>. To correctly override the <code>equals()</code> method in <code>java.lang.Object</code>, the parameter of <code>equals()</code> must have type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.

* NP: Clone method may return null  (NP_CLONE_COULD_RETURN_NULL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This clone method seems to return null in some circumstances, but clone is never allowed to return a null value.  If you are convinced this path is unreachable, throw an AssertionError instead. 

* FI: Finalizer should be protected, not public  (FI_PUBLIC_SHOULD_BE_PROTECTED)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:A class's <code>finalize()</code> method should have protected access, not public.

* WMI: Inefficient use of keySet iterator instead of entrySet iterator (WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method accesses the value of a Map entry, using a key that was retrieved from a keySet iterator. It is more efficient to use an iterator on the entrySet of the map, to avoid the Map.get(key) lookup.

* NP: Method may return null, but is declared @NonNull  (NP_NONNULL_RETURN_VIOLATION)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method may return a null value, but the method (or a superclass method which it overrides) is declared to return @NonNull. 

* IJU: TestCase implements a non-static suite method   (IJU_SUITE_NOT_STATIC)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Class is a JUnit TestCase and implements the suite() method. The suite method should be declared as being static, but isn't.

* LG: Potential lost logger changes due to weak reference in OpenJDK  (LG_LOST_LOGGER_DUE_TO_WEAK_REFERENCE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:OpenJDK introduces a potential incompatibility. In particular, the java.util.logging.Logger behavior has changed. Instead of using strong references, it now uses weak references internally. That's a reasonable change, but unfortunately some code relies on the old behavior - when changing logger configuration, it simply drops the logger reference. That means that the garbage collector is free to reclaim that memory, which means that the logger configuration is lost.
:For example, consider: <pre>public static void initLogging() throws Exception { Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("edu.umd.cs"); logger.addHandler(new FileHandler()); /* call to change logger configuration */ logger.setUseParentHandlers(false); /* another call to change logger configuration */ }</pre>. The logger reference is lost at the end of the method (it doesn't escape the method), so if you have a garbage collection cycle just after the call to initLogging, the logger configuration is lost (because Logger only keeps weak references). <pre>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { initLogging(); /* adds a file handler to the logger */ System.gc(); /* logger configuration lost */ Logger.getLogger("edu.umd.cs").info("Some message"); /* this isn't logged to the file as expected */}</pre> --- <em>Ulf Ochsenfahrt and Eric Fellheimer</em>.

* FI: Finalizer only nulls fields (FI_FINALIZER_ONLY_NULLS_FIELDS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This finalizer does nothing except null out fields. This is completely pointless, and requires that the object be garbage collected, finalized, and then garbage collected again. You should just remove the finalize method.

* UR: Uninitialized read of field method called from constructor of superclass  (UR_UNINIT_READ_CALLED_FROM_SUPER_CONSTRUCTOR)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method is invoked in the constructor of of the superclass. At this point, the fields of the class have not yet initialized.
:To make this more concrete, consider the following classes: <pre>abstract class A { int hashCode; abstract Object getValue(); A() { hashCode = getValue().hashCode(); } } class B extends A { Object value; B(Object v) { this.value = v; } Object getValue() { return value; } }</pre>
:When a <code>B</code> is constructed, the constructor for the <code>A</code> class is invoked before the constructor for <code>B</code> sets value. Thus, when the constructor for <code>A</code> invokes getValue, an uninitialized value is read for value.

* Se: Private readResolve method not inherited by subclasses  (SE_PRIVATE_READ_RESOLVE_NOT_INHERITED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a private readResolve method. Since it is private, it won't be inherited by subclasses. This might be intentional and OK, but should be reviewed to ensure it is what is intended. 

* SA: Double assignment of field  (SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method contains a double assignment of a field; e.g. <pre>int x,y; public void foo() { x = x = 17; }</pre>. Assigning to a field twice is useless, and may indicate a logic error or typo.

* Nm: Class defines equal(Object); should it be equals(Object)? (NM_BAD_EQUAL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class defines a method <code>equal(Object)</code>. This method does not override the <code>equals(Object)</code> method in <code>java.lang.Object</code>, which is probably what was intended.

* Empty Catch Block (EmptyCatchBlock)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Empty Catch Block finds instances where an exception is caught, but nothing is done. In most circumstances, this swallows an exception which should either be acted on or reported.
:This rule impacts reliability, since nothing is done about the exception and unpredictable behaviour may occur.

* MS: Field should be moved out of an interface and made package protected  (MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT)
** Category: SEC
** Priority: 4
** Description:
:A final static field that is defined in an interface references a mutable object such as an array or hashtable. This mutable object could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. To solve this, the field needs to be moved to a class and made package protected to avoid this vulnerability.

* IL: An apparent infinite loop  (IL_INFINITE_LOOP)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This loop doesn't seem to have a way to terminate (other than by perhaps throwing an exception).

* NP: Nonnull field is not initialized  (NP_NONNULL_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The field is marked as nonnull, but isn't written to by the constructor. The field might be initialized elsewhere during constructor, or might always be initialized before use. 

* NP: Method call passes null for nonnull parameter  (NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF_ALL_TARGETS_DANGEROUS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A possibly-null value is passed at a call site where all known target methods require the parameter to be nonnull. Either the parameter is annotated as a parameter that should always be nonnull, or analysis has shown that it will always be dereferenced. 

* Dm: Method invokes inefficient new String(String) constructor (DM_STRING_CTOR)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:Using the <code>java.lang.String(String)</code> constructor wastes memory because the object so constructed will be functionally indistinguishable from the <code>String</code> passed as a parameter. Just use the argument <code>String</code> directly.

* Use Notify All Instead Of Notify (UseNotifyAllInsteadOfNotify)
** Category: REL
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Thread.notify() awakens a thread monitoring the object. If more than one thread is monitoring, then only one is chosen. The thread chosen is arbitrary; thus its usually safer to call notifyAll() instead.
:This rule impacts reliability, since the notified thread is chosen arbitrary among the waiters and an unintended behaviour may arise.

* Empty Statement Block (EmptyStatementBlock)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Empty finally blocks serve no purpose and should be removed.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.

* OS: Method may fail to close stream on exception  (OS_OPEN_STREAM_EXCEPTION_PATH)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:The method creates an IO stream object, does not assign it to any fields, pass it to other methods, or return it, and does not appear to close it on all possible exception paths out of the method. This may result in a file descriptor leak. It is generally a good idea to use a <code>finally</code> block to ensure that streams are closed.

* NP: equals() method does not check for null argument  (NP_EQUALS_SHOULD_HANDLE_NULL_ARGUMENT)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This implementation of equals(Object) violates the contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals() because it does not check for null being passed as the argument.  All equals() methods should return false if passed a null value. 

* RV: Method ignores return value, is this OK?  (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This code calls a method and ignores the return value. The return value is the same type as the type the method is invoked on, and from our analysis it looks like the return value might be important (e.g., like ignoring the return value of <code>String.toLowerCase()</code>). 

* SA: Self comparison of field with itself  (SA_FIELD_SELF_COMPARISON)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method compares a field with itself, and may indicate a typo or a logic error.  Make sure that you are comparing the right things. 

* Eq: Unusual equals method   (EQ_UNUSUAL)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This class doesn't do any of the patterns we recognize for checking that the type of the argument is compatible with the type of the <code>this</code> object. There might not be anything wrong with this code, but it is worth reviewing. 

* CNT: Rough value of known constant found  (CNT_ROUGH_CONSTANT_VALUE)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:It's recommended to use the predefined library constant for code clarity and better precision.

* Uncommented Empty Constructor (UncommentedEmptyConstructor)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Uncommented Empty Constructor finds instances where a constructor does not contain statements, but there is no comment. By explicitly commenting empty constructors it is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented) and unintentional empty constructors.
:This rule impacts analysability, since the maintainer does not know if the empty constructor was really intended and useful.

* ML: Synchronization on field in futile attempt to guard that field  (ML_SYNC_ON_FIELD_TO_GUARD_CHANGING_THAT_FIELD)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:This method synchronizes on a field in what appears to be an attempt to guard against simultaneous updates to that field. But guarding a field gets a lock on the referenced object, not on the field. This may not provide the mutual exclusion you need, and other threads might be obtaining locks on the referenced objects (for other purposes). An example of this pattern would be: <pre>private Long myNtfSeqNbrCounter = new Long(0); private Long getNotificationSequenceNumber() { Long result = null; synchronized(myNtfSeqNbrCounter) { result = new Long(myNtfSeqNbrCounter.longValue() + 1); myNtfSeqNbrCounter = new Long(result.longValue()); } return result; } </pre>

* HE: Signature declares use of unhashable class in hashed construct  (HE_SIGNATURE_DECLARES_HASHING_OF_UNHASHABLE_CLASS)
** Category: 
** Priority: 
** Description:
:A method, field or class declares a generic signature where a non-hashable class is used in context where a hashable class is required. A class that declares an equals method but inherits a hashCode() method from Object is unhashable, since it doesn't fulfill the requirement that equal objects have equal hashCodes. 

* Logic Inversion (LogicInversion)
** Category: ANA
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:Use opposite operator instead of negating the whole expression with a logic complement operator.
:This rule impacts analysability, since it is easier to read a condition than its negation.

* Coupling Between Objects (CouplingBetweenObjects)
** Category: REU
** Priority: 3
** Description:
:This rule counts the number of unique attributes, local variables, and return types within an object. A number higher than the specified threshold can indicate a high degree of coupling. The default value is set to 20.
:CouplingBetweenObjects attempts to capture all unique Class attributes, local variables, and return types to determine how many objects a class is coupled to. This is only a gauge and isn't a hard and fast rule. The threshold value is configurable and should be determined accordingly.
:This rule impacts reusability, since many classes need to be available for this class to work.
