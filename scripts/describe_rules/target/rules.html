<h1>List of rules for the PolarSys Maturity Assessment quality model</h1>
<h4>TQ: Value without a type qualifier used where a value is required to have that qualifier  (TQ_UNKNOWN_VALUE_USED_WHERE_ALWAYS_STRICTLY_REQUIRED)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A value is being used in a way that requires the value be annotation with a type qualifier. The type qualifier is strict, so the tool rejects any values that do not have the appropriate annotation. To coerce a value to have a strict annotation, define an identity function where the return value is annotated with the strict annotation. This is the only way to turn a non-annotated value into a value with a strict type qualifier annotation. </p>
<h4>UuF: Unused field (UUF_UNUSED_FIELD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This field is never used. Consider removing it from the class.</p>
<h4>FI: Finalizer only nulls fields (FI_FINALIZER_ONLY_NULLS_FIELDS)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This finalizer does nothing except null out fields. This is completely pointless, and requires that the object be garbage collected, finalized, and then garbage collected again. You should just remove the finalize method.</p>
<h4>UrF: Unread public/protected field  (URF_UNREAD_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This field is never read. The field is public or protected, so perhaps it is intended to be used with classes not seen as part of the analysis. If not, consider removing it from the class.</p>
<h4>Eq: equals() method defined that doesn't override Object.equals(Object) (EQ_OTHER_USE_OBJECT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR REU</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class defines an <code>equals()</code> method, that doesn't override the normal <code>equals(Object)</code> method defined in the base <code>java.lang.Object</code> class. The class should probably define a <code>boolean equals(Object)</code> method. </p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will be confused by this method's name.</p>
<h4>SA: Self assignment of local variable  (SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method contains a self assignment of a local variable; e.g.</p> <pre> public void foo() { int x = 3; x = x; } </pre> Such assignments are useless, and may indicate a logic error or typo. </p>
<h4>INT: Bad comparison of signed byte (INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_SIGNED_BYTE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Signed bytes can only have a value in the range -128 to 127. Comparing a signed byte with a value outside that range is vacuous and likely to be incorrect. To convert a signed byte <code>b</code> to an unsigned value in the range 0..255, use <code>0xff &amp; b</code>.</p>
<h4>CD: Test for circular dependencies among classes  (CD_CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCY)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class has a circular dependency with other classes. This makes building these classes difficult, as each is dependent on the other to build correctly. Consider using interfaces to break the hard dependency. </p>
<h4>FS: Format string should use %n rather than 
  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_USES_NEWLINE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This format string includes a newline character (
). In format strings, it is generally preferable better to use %n, which will produce the platform-specific line separator. </p>
<h4>IIO: Inefficient use of String.indexOf(String) (IIO_INEFFICIENT_INDEX_OF)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This code passes a constant string of length 1 to String.indexOf(). It is more efficient to use the integer implementations of String.indexOf(). f. e. call <code>myString.indexOf('.')</code> instead of <code>myString.indexOf(".")</code></p>
<h4>Nm: Very confusing method names (but perhaps intentional) (NM_VERY_CONFUSING_INTENTIONAL)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization. This is very confusing because if the capitalization were identical then one of the methods would override the other. From the existence of other methods, it seems that the existence of both of these methods is intentional, but is sure is confusing. You should try hard to eliminate one of them, unless you are forced to have both due to frozen APIs. </p>
<h4>SA: Self assignment of local rather than assignment to field  (SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT_INSTEAD_OF_FIELD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method contains a self assignment of a local variable, and there is a field with an identical name. assignment appears to have been ; e.g. <pre>public void setFoo(int foo) { foo = foo; }</pre>. The assignment is useless. Did you mean to assign to the field instead?</p>
<h4>ML: Synchronization on field in futile attempt to guard that field  (ML_SYNC_ON_FIELD_TO_GUARD_CHANGING_THAT_FIELD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method synchronizes on a field in what appears to be an attempt to guard against simultaneous updates to that field. But guarding a field gets a lock on the referenced object, not on the field. This may not provide the mutual exclusion you need, and other threads might be obtaining locks on the referenced objects (for other purposes). An example of this pattern would be: <pre>private Long myNtfSeqNbrCounter = new Long(0); private Long getNotificationSequenceNumber() { Long result = null; synchronized(myNtfSeqNbrCounter) { result = new Long(myNtfSeqNbrCounter.longValue() + 1); myNtfSeqNbrCounter = new Long(result.longValue()); } return result; } </pre></p>
<h4>NP: Null pointer dereference in method on exception path  (NP_ALWAYS_NULL_EXCEPTION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A pointer which is null on an exception path is dereferenced here. This will lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed. Note that because FindBugs currently does not prune infeasible exception paths, this may be a false warning.</p>
<p class="desc">Also note that FindBugs considers the default case of a switch statement to be an exception path, since the default case is often infeasible.</p>
<h4>RV: Method ignores return value  (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The return value of this method should be checked. One common cause of this warning is to invoke a method on an immutable object, thinking that it updates the object. For example, in the following code fragment, <code>String dateString = getHeaderField(name); dateString.trim();</code> the programmer seems to be thinking that the trim() method will update the String referenced by dateString. But since Strings are immutable, the trim() function returns a new String value, which is being ignored here. The code should be corrected to: <code>String dateString = getHeaderField(name); dateString = dateString.trim();</code>.</p>
<h4>DLS: Useless increment in return statement (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_INCREMENT_IN_RETURN)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This statement has a return such as <code>return x++;</code>. A postfix increment/decrement does not impact the value of the expression, so this increment/decrement has no effect. Please verify that this statement does the right thing.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since a maintainer will wonder why the increment has been added if not used.</p>
<h4>Dm: Use the nextInt method of Random rather than nextDouble to generate a random integer  (DM_NEXTINT_VIA_NEXTDOUBLE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">If <code>r</code> is a <code>java.util.Random</code>, you can generate a random number from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code> using <code>r.nextInt(n)</code>, rather than using <code>(int)(r.nextDouble() * n)</code>. </p>
<p class="desc">The argument to nextInt must be positive. If, for example, you want to generate a random value from -99 to 0, use <code>-r.nextInt(100)</code>.</p>
<h4>STI: Static Thread.interrupted() method invoked on thread instance  (STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_UNKNOWNTHREAD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method invokes the Thread.interrupted() method on a Thread object that appears to be a Thread object that is not the current thread. As the interrupted() method is static, the interrupted method will be called on a different object than the one the author intended. </p>
<h4>ICAST: int value converted to long and used as absolute time (ICAST_INT_2_LONG_AS_INSTANT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This code converts a 32-bit int value to a 64-bit long value, and then passes that value for a method parameter that requires an absolute time value. An absolute time value is the number of milliseconds since the standard base time known as <em>the epoch</em>, namely January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. For example, the following method, intended to convert seconds since the epoc into a Date, is badly broken: <pre>Date getDate(int seconds) { return new Date(seconds * 1000); } </pre>.</p>
<p class="desc">The multiplication is done using 32-bit arithmetic, and then converted to a 64-bit value. When a 32-bit value is converted to 64-bits and used to express an absolute time value, only dates in December 1969 and January 1970 can be represented.</p>
<p class="desc">Correct implementations for the above method are: <pre>// Fails for dates after 2037
 Date getDate(int seconds) { return new Date(seconds * 1000L); } 
// better, works for all dates 
 Date getDate(long seconds) { return new Date(seconds * 1000); }</pre></p>
<h4>HE: Class inherits equals() and uses Object.hashCode() (HE_INHERITS_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class inherits <code>equals(Object)</code> from an abstract superclass, and <code>hashCode()</code> from <code>java.lang.Object</code> (which returns the identity hash code, an arbitrary value assigned to the object by the VM). Therefore, the class is very likely to violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.</p>
<p class="desc">If you don't want to define a hashCode method, and/or don't believe the object will ever be put into a HashMap/Hashtable, define the <code>hashCode()</code> method to throw <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>.</p>
<h4>PT: Absolute path traversal in servlet  (PT_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TRAVERSAL)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The software uses an HTTP request parameter to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory. See <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html">http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/36.html</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="desc">FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of absolute path traversal. If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about absolute path traversal, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.</p>
<h4>OBL: Method may fail to clean up stream or resource  (OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method may fail to clean up (close, dispose of) a stream, database object, or other resource requiring an explicit cleanup operation.  In general, if a method opens a stream or other resource, the method should use a try/finally block to ensure that the stream or resource is cleaned up before the method returns.</p>
<p class="desc">This bug pattern is essentially the same as the OS_OPEN_STREAM and ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE bug patterns, but is based on a different (and hopefully better) static analysis technique. See Weimer and Necula, <em>Finding and Preventing Run-Time Error Handling Mistakes</em>, for a description of the analysis technique. </p>
<h4>HE: Class defines equals() and uses Object.hashCode() (HE_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class overrides <code>equals(Object)</code>, but does not override <code>hashCode()</code>, and inherits the implementation of <code>hashCode()</code> from <code>java.lang.Object</code> (which returns the identity hash code, an arbitrary value assigned to the object by the VM). Therefore, the class is very likely to violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.</p>
<p class="desc">If you don't think instances of this class will ever be inserted into a HashMap/HashTable, the recommended hashCode implementation to use is: <pre>public int hashCode() { assert false : "hashCode not designed"; return 42; /* any arbitrary constant will do */ }</pre>.</p>
<h4>EC: equals(...) used to compare incompatible arrays (EC_INCOMPATIBLE_ARRAY_COMPARE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method invokes the .equals(Object o) to compare two arrays, but the arrays are of incompatible types (e.g., String[] and StringBuffer[], or String[] and int[]). They will never be equal. In addition, when equals(...) is used to compare arrays it only checks to see if they are the same array, and ignores the contents of the arrays. </p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4>SQL: Method attempts to access a result set field with index 0  (SQL_BAD_RESULTSET_ACCESS)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A call to getXXX or updateXXX methods of a result set was made where the field index is 0. As ResultSet fields start at index 1, this is always a mistake.</p>
<h4>SQL: A prepared statement is generated from a nonconstant String  (SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The code creates an SQL prepared statement from a nonconstant String. If unchecked, tainted data from a user is used in building this String, SQL injection could be used to make the prepared statement do something unexpected and undesirable. </p>
<h4>MS: Field should be both final and package protected  (MS_FINAL_PKGPROTECT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A mutable static field could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. The field could be made package protected and/or made final to avoid this vulnerability.</p>
<h4>HRS: HTTP Response splitting vulnerability  (HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_HTTP_HEADER)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to an HTTP header, which allows for a HTTP response splitting vulnerability. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="desc">FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of HTTP response splitting. If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about HTTP response splitting, you should seriouslyconsider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.</p>
<h4>USELESS_STRING: Invocation of toString on an unnamed array  (DMI_INVOKING_TOSTRING_ON_ANONYMOUS_ARRAY)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The code invokes toString on an (anonymous) array.  Calling toString on an array generates a fairly useless result such as [C@16f0472. Consider using Arrays.toString to convert the array into a readable String that gives the contents of the array. See Programming Puzzlers, chapter 3, puzzle 12. </p>
<h4>NP: Store of null value into field annotated NonNull  (NP_STORE_INTO_NONNULL_FIELD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A value that could be null is stored into a field that has been annotated as NonNull.</p>
<h4>RCN: Redundant nullcheck of value known to be null  (RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NULL_VALUE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method contains a redundant check of a known null value against the constant null.</p>
<h4>RI: Class implements same interface as superclass  (RI_REDUNDANT_INTERFACES)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class declares that it implements an interface that is also implemented by a superclass. This is redundant because once a superclass implements an interface, all subclasses by default also implement this interface. It may point out that the inheritance hierarchy has changed since this class was created, and consideration should be given to the ownership of the interface's implementation. </p>
<h4>Dm: Call to unsupported method  (DMI_UNSUPPORTED_METHOD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">All targets of this method invocation throw an UnsupportedOperationException. </p>
<h4>FI: Finalizer does not call superclass finalizer (FI_MISSING_SUPER_CALL)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This <code>finalize()</code> method does not make a call to its superclass's <code>finalize()</code> method. So, any finalizer actions defined for the superclass will not be performed. Add a call to <code>super.finalize()</code>.</p>
<h4>NP: Method call passes null for nonnull parameter  (NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF_ALL_TARGETS_DANGEROUS)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A possibly-null value is passed at a call site where all known target methods require the parameter to be nonnull. Either the parameter is annotated as a parameter that should always be nonnull, or analysis has shown that it will always be dereferenced. </p>
<h4>EC: equals() used to compare array and nonarray (EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAY)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method invokes the .equals(Object o) to compare an array and a reference that doesn't seem to be an array. If things being compared are of different types, they are guaranteed to be unequal and the comparison is almost certainly an error. Even if they are both arrays, the equals method on arrays only determines of the two arrays are the same object. To compare the contents of the arrays, use java.util.Arrays.equals(Object[], Object[]). </p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4>NP: Possible null pointer dereference in method on exception path  (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_EXCEPTION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A reference value which is null on some exception control path is dereferenced here. This may lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed. Note that because FindBugs currently does not prune infeasible exception paths, this may be a false warning.</p>
<p class="desc">Also note that FindBugs considers the default case of a switch statement to be an exception path, since the default case is often infeasible.</p>
<h4>FS: MessageFormat supplied where printf style format expected  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXPECTED_MESSAGE_FORMAT_SUPPLIED)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A method is called that expects a Java printf format string and a list of arguments. However, the format string doesn't contain any format specifiers (e.g., %s) but does contain message format elements (e.g., {0}).  It is likely that the code is supplying a MessageFormat string when a printf-style format string is required. At runtime, all of the arguments will be ignored and the format string will be returned exactly as provided without any formatting. </p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4>RV: Bad attempt to compute absolute value of signed random integer  (RV_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_OF_RANDOM_INT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This code generates a random signed integer and then computes the absolute value of that random integer.  If the number returned by the random number generator is <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>, then the result will be negative as well (since <code>Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) == Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>). (Same problem arised for long values as well). </p>
<h4>NP: toString method may return null  (NP_TOSTRING_COULD_RETURN_NULL)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This toString method seems to return null in some circumstances. A liberal reading of the spec could be interpreted as allowing this, but it is probably a bad idea and could cause other code to break. Return the empty string or some other appropriate string rather than null. </p>
<h4>DL: Synchronization on Boolean  (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOOLEAN)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Boolean.</p> <pre> private static Boolean inited = Boolean.FALSE; ... synchronized(inited) { if (!inited) { init(); inited = Boolean.TRUE; } } ... </pre> Since there normally exist only two Boolean objects, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock.</p>
<p class="desc">See CERT <a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/CON08-J.+Do+not+synchronize+on+objects+that+may+be+reused">CON08-J. Do not synchronize on objects that may be reused</a> for more information.</p>
<h4>BIT: Check to see if ((...) & 0) == 0 (BIT_AND_ZZ)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method compares an expression of the form (e &amp; 0) to 0, which will always compare equal. This may indicate a logic error or typo.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is probably not what was intended.</p>
<h4>Ru: Invokes run on a thread (did you mean to start it instead?) (RU_INVOKE_RUN)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method explicitly invokes <code>run()</code> on an object. In general, classes implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface because they are going to have their <code>run()</code> method invoked in a new thread, in which case <code>Thread.start()</code> is the right method to call.</p>
<h4>SIO: Unnecessary type check done using instanceof operator  (SIO_SUPERFLUOUS_INSTANCEOF)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Type check performed using the instanceof operator where it can be statically determined whether the object is of the type requested. </p>
<h4>Eq: Unusual equals method   (EQ_UNUSUAL)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class doesn't do any of the patterns we recognize for checking that the type of the argument is compatible with the type of the <code>this</code> object. There might not be anything wrong with this code, but it is worth reviewing. </p>
<h4>NP: Possible null pointer dereference due to return value of called method  (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_FROM_RETURN_VALUE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The return value from a method is dereferenced without a null check, and the return value of that method is one that should generally be checked for null.  This may lead to a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed. </p>
<h4>Wa: Condition.await() not in loop (WA_AWAIT_NOT_IN_LOOP)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method contains a call to <code>java.util.concurrent.await()</code> (or variants) which is not in a loop. If the object is used for multiple conditions, the condition the caller intended to wait for might not be the one that actually occurred.</p>
<h4>Dm: Thread passed where Runnable expected  (DMI_THREAD_PASSED_WHERE_RUNNABLE_EXPECTED)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A Thread object is passed as a parameter to a method where a Runnable is expected. This is rather unusual, and may indicate a logic error or cause unexpected behavior. </p>
<h4>WL: Synchronization on getClass rather than class literal  (WL_USING_GETCLASS_RATHER_THAN_CLASS_LITERAL)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This instance method synchronizes on <code>this.getClass()</code>. If this class is subclassed, subclasses will synchronize on the class object for the subclass, which isn't likely what was intended. For example, consider this code from java.awt.Label: <pre>private static final String base = "label"; private static int nameCounter = 0; String constructComponentName() { synchronized (getClass()) { return base + nameCounter++; } }</pre>.</p>
<p class="desc">Subclasses of <code>Label</code> won't synchronize on the same subclass, giving rise to a datarace. Instead, this code should be synchronizing on <code>Label.class</code>: <pre>private static final String base = "label"; private static int nameCounter = 0; String constructComponentName() { synchronized (Label.class) { return base + nameCounter++; } }</pre> --- <em>Bug pattern contributed by Jason Mehrens</em></p>
<h4>IJU: JUnit assertion in run method will not be noticed by JUnit  (IJU_ASSERT_METHOD_INVOKED_FROM_RUN_METHOD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A JUnit assertion is performed in a run method. Failed JUnit assertions just result in exceptions being thrown. Thus, if this exception occurs in a thread other than the thread that invokes the test method, the exception will terminate the thread but not result in the test failing. </p>
<h4>DP: Classloaders should only be created inside doPrivileged block (DP_CREATE_CLASSLOADER_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 4</p>

<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The method in the subclass doesn't override a similar method in a superclass because the type of a parameter doesn't exactly match the type of the corresponding parameter in the superclass.

<p class="desc">The <code>f(Foo)</code> method defined in class <code>B</code> doesn't override the <code>f(Foo)</code> method defined in class A, because the argument types are Foo's from different packages. In this case, the subclass does define a method with a signature identical to the method in the superclass, so this is presumably understood. However, such methods are exceptionally confusing.

<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Using <code>new Double(double)</code> is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas <code>Double.valueOf(double)</code> allows caching of values to be done by the compiler, class library, or JVM. Using of cached values avoids object allocation and the code will be faster. </p>
<p class="desc">Values between -128 and 127 are guaranteed to have corresponding cached instances and using <code>valueOf</code> is approximately 3.5 times faster than using constructor. For values outside the constant range the performance of both styles is the same.</p>
<p class="desc">Unless the class must be compatible with JVMs predating Java 1.5, use either autoboxing or the <code>valueOf()</code> method when creating instances of <code>Long</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Short</code>, <code>Character</code>, and <code>Byte</code>.</p>

With the creation of the peer, the system creates the event dispatch thread. This makes things problematic because the event dispatch thread could be notifying listeners while pack and validate are still processing. This situation could result in two threads going through the Swing component-based GUI -- it's a serious flaw that could result in deadlocks or other related threading issues. A pack call causes components to be realized. As they are being realized (that is, not necessarily visible), they could trigger listener notification on the event dispatch thread.</p>

For example, if the Foo and Bar classes are not related by subtyping, then an instance of Foo should not be equal to an instance of Bar. Among other issues, doing so will likely result in an equals method that is not symmetrical. For example, if you define the Foo class so that a Foo can be equal to a String, your equals method isn't symmetrical since a String can only be equal to a String.</p>

<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">OpenJDK introduces a potential incompatibility. In particular, the java.util.logging.Logger behavior has changed. Instead of using strong references, it now uses weak references internally. That's a reasonable change, but unfortunately some code relies on the old behavior - when changing logger configuration, it simply drops the logger reference. That means that the garbage collector is free to reclaim that memory, which means that the logger configuration is lost.</p>
<p class="desc">For example, consider: <pre>public static void initLogging() throws Exception { Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("edu.umd.cs"); logger.addHandler(new FileHandler()); /* call to change logger configuration */ logger.setUseParentHandlers(false); /* another call to change logger configuration */ }</pre>. The logger reference is lost at the end of the method (it doesn't escape the method), so if you have a garbage collection cycle just after the call to initLogging, the logger configuration is lost (because Logger only keeps weak references). <pre>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { initLogging(); /* adds a file handler to the logger */ System.gc(); /* logger configuration lost */ Logger.getLogger("edu.umd.cs").info("Some message"); /* this isn't logged to the file as expected */}</pre> --- <em>Ulf Ochsenfahrt and Eric Fellheimer</em>.</p>

In the past, situations where people have explicitly invoked the garbage collector in routines such as close or finalize methods has led to huge performance black holes. Garbage collection can be expensive. Any situation that forces hundreds or thousands of garbage collections will bring the machine to a crawl.</p>
<h4>NP: Synchronize and null check on the same field.  (NP_SYNC_AND_NULL_CHECK_FIELD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Since the field is synchronized on, it seems not likely to be null. If it is null and then synchronized on a NullPointerException will be thrown and the check would be pointless. Better to synchronize on another field.</p>
<h4>Eq: Covariant equals() method defined (EQ_SELF_NO_OBJECT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class defines a covariant version of <code>equals()</code>. To correctly override the <code>equals()</code> method in <code>java.lang.Object</code>, the parameter of <code>equals()</code> must have type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.</p>
<h4>AT: Sequence of calls to concurrent abstraction may not be atomic  (AT_OPERATION_SEQUENCE_ON_CONCURRENT_ABSTRACTION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR THR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This code contains a sequence of calls to a concurrent abstraction (such as a concurrent hash map). These calls will not be executed atomically.</p>
<h4>IM: Check for oddness that won't work for negative numbers   (IM_BAD_CHECK_FOR_ODD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The code uses x % 2 == 1 to check to see if a value is odd, but this won't work for negative numbers (e.g., (-5) % 2 == -1). If this code is intending to check for oddness, consider using x &amp; 1 == 1, or x % 2 != 0. </p>
<h4>Eq: equals method overrides equals in superclass and may not be symmetric  (EQ_OVERRIDING_EQUALS_NOT_SYMMETRIC)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR REU</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class defines an equals method that overrides an equals method in a superclass. Both equals methods use <code>instanceof</code> in the determination of whether two objects are equal. This is fraught with peril, since it is important that the equals method is symmetrical (in other words, <code>a.equals(b) == b.equals(a)</code>). If B is a subtype of A, and A's equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof A, and B's equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof B, it is quite likely that the equivalence relation defined by these methods is not symmetric. </p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will assume the method is symmetric.</p>
<h4>SnVI: Class is Serializable, but doesn't define serialVersionUID  (SE_NO_SERIALVERSIONID)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class implements the <code>Serializable</code> interface, but does not define a <code>serialVersionUID</code> field. A change as simple as adding a reference to a .class object will add synthetic fields to the class, which will unfortunately change the implicit serialVersionUID (e.g., adding a reference to <code>String.class</code> will generate a static field <code>class$java$lang$String</code>). Also, different source code to bytecode compilers may use different naming conventions for synthetic variables generated for references to class objects or inner classes. To ensure interoperability of Serializable across versions, consider adding an explicit serialVersionUID.</p>
