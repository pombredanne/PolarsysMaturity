<h1>List of rules for the PolarSys Maturity Assessment quality model</h1>
<h4>DLS: Dead store of class literal  (DLS_DEAD_STORE_OF_CLASS_LITERAL)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This instruction assigns a class literal to a variable and then never uses it. <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/compatibility.html#literal">The behavior of this differs in Java 1.4 and in Java 5.</a> In Java 1.4 and earlier, a reference to <code>Foo.class</code> would force the static initializer for <code>Foo</code> to be executed, if it has not been executed already. In Java 5 and later, it does not. </p>
<p class="desc">See Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/compatibility.html#literal">article on Java SE compatibility for more details and examples, and suggestions on how to force class initialization in Java 5.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it implies useless code.</p>
<h4>TQ: Value that might carry a type qualifier is always used in a way that prohibits it from having that type qualifier  (TQ_MAYBE_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINK)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A value that is annotated as possibility being an instance of the values denoted by the type qualifier, and the value is guaranteed to be used in a way that prohibits values denoted by that type qualifier. </p>
<h4>Avoid Multiple Unary Operators (AvoidMultipleUnaryOperators)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The use of multiple unary operators may be problematic, and/or confusing. Ensure that the intended usage is not a bug, or consider simplifying the expression.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts the reliability, since the pattern has a good probability to be a bug. It also impacts analysability, since such unary operators are unnecessarily complex to understand.</p>
<h4>CI: Class is final but declares protected field  (CI_CONFUSED_INHERITANCE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class is declared to be final, but declares fields to be protected. Since the class is final, it can not be derived from, and the use of protected is confusing. The access modifier for the field should be changed to private or public to represent the true use for the field. </p>
<h4>Unused Local Variable (UnusedLocalVariable)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA EFF</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Detects when a local variable is declared and/or assigned, but not used.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts analysability, since the maintainer will not understand why this variable is declared. It also impacts resources, since there is an unused declared variable.</p>
<h4>ML: Method synchronizes on an updated field  (ML_SYNC_ON_UPDATED_FIELD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method synchronizes on an object referenced from a mutable field. This is unlikely to have useful semantics, since different threads may be synchronizing on different objects.</p>
<h4>NP: Possible null pointer dereference on branch that might be infeasible  (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_MIGHT_BE_INFEASIBLE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">There is a branch of statement that, <em>if executed,</em>  guarantees that a null value will be dereferenced, which would generate a <code>NullPointerException</code> when the code is executed. Of course, the problem might be that the branch or statement is infeasible and that the null pointer exception can't ever be executed; deciding that is beyond the ability of FindBugs. Due to the fact that this value had been previously tested for nullness, this is a definite possibility. </p>
<h4>SIC: Could be refactored into a named static inner class  (SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference to the object which created it. This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary. If possible, the class should be made into a <em>static</em> inner class. Since anonymous inner classes cannot be marked as static, doing this will require refactoring the inner class so that it is a named inner class.</p>
<h4>RV: Code checks for specific values returned by compareTo  (RV_CHECK_COMPARETO_FOR_SPECIFIC_RETURN_VALUE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This code invoked a compareTo or compare method, and checks to see if the return value is a specific value, such as 1 or -1. When invoking these methods, you should only check the sign of the result, not for any specific non-zero value. While many or most compareTo and compare methods only return -1, 0 or 1, some of them will return other values.</p>
<h4>IMA: Method accesses a private member variable of owning class  (IMA_INEFFICIENT_MEMBER_ACCESS)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method of an inner class reads from or writes to a private member variable of the owning class, or calls a private method of the owning class. The compiler must generate a special method to access this private member, causing this to be less efficient. Relaxing the protection of the member variable or method will allow the compiler to treat this as a normal access. </p>
<h4>Broken NullCheck (BrokenNullCheck)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The null check is broken since it will throw a NullPointerException itself. It is likely that you used || instead of && or vice versa.</p>
<p class="desc">This pattern impacts the reliability, since an exception may be thrown.</p>
<h4>FL: Method performs math using floating point precision  (FL_MATH_USING_FLOAT_PRECISION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The method performs math operations using floating point precision. Floating point precision is very imprecise. For example, 16777216.0f + 1.0f = 16777216.0f. Consider using double math instead.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended.</p>
<h4>Nm: Very confusing method names (but perhaps intentional) (NM_VERY_CONFUSING_INTENTIONAL)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization. This is very confusing because if the capitalization were identical then one of the methods would override the other. From the existence of other methods, it seems that the existence of both of these methods is intentional, but is sure is confusing. You should try hard to eliminate one of them, unless you are forced to have both due to frozen APIs. </p>
<h4>Se: Class is Serializable but its superclass doesn't define a void constructor  (SE_NO_SUITABLE_CONSTRUCTOR)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 2</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class implements the <code>Serializable</code> interface and its superclass does not. When such an object is deserialized, the fields of the superclass need to be initialized by invoking the void constructor of the superclass. Since the superclass does not have one, serialization and deserialization will fail at runtime.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts reliability, since an exception will be thrown at runtime when deserialising the object.</p>
<h4>Empty Statement Not In Loop (EmptyStatementNotInLoop)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">An empty statement (or a semicolon by itself) that is not used as the sole body of a 'for' or 'while' loop is probably a bug. It could also be a double semicolon, which has no purpose and should be removed.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.</p>
<h4>Dm: Use the nextInt method of Random rather than nextDouble to generate a random integer  (DM_NEXTINT_VIA_NEXTDOUBLE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">If <code>r</code> is a <code>java.util.Random</code>, you can generate a random number from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code> using <code>r.nextInt(n)</code>, rather than using <code>(int)(r.nextDouble() * n)</code>. </p>
<p class="desc">The argument to nextInt must be positive. If, for example, you want to generate a random value from -99 to 0, use <code>-r.nextInt(100)</code>.</p>
<h4>UG: Unsynchronized get method, synchronized set method  (UG_SYNC_SET_UNSYNC_GET)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class contains similarly-named get and set methods where the set method is synchronized and the get method is not. This may result in incorrect behavior at runtime, as callers of the get method will not necessarily see a consistent state for the object. The get method should be made synchronized.</p>
<h4>Eq: equals() method defined that doesn't override Object.equals(Object) (EQ_OTHER_USE_OBJECT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR REU</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class defines an <code>equals()</code> method, that doesn't override the normal <code>equals(Object)</code> method defined in the base <code>java.lang.Object</code> class. The class should probably define a <code>boolean equals(Object)</code> method. </p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will be confused by this method's name.</p>
<h4>RV: Exception created and dropped rather than thrown (RV_EXCEPTION_NOT_THROWN)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This code creates an exception (or error) object, but doesn't do anything with it. For example, something like <pre>if (x < 0) new IllegalArgumentException("x must be nonnegative");</code>. It was probably the intent of the programmer to throw the created exception:<code>if (x < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("x must be nonnegative");</code>.</p>
<h4>BIT: Incompatible bit masks  (BIT_AND)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method compares an expression of the form (e &amp; C) to D, which will always compare unequal due to the specific values of constants C and D. This may indicate a logic error or typo.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is probably not what was intended.</p>
<h4>UseUtilityClass (UseUtilityClass)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REU</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">For classes that only have static methods, consider making them utility classes. Note that this doesn't apply to abstract classes, since their subclasses may well include non-static methods. Also, if you want this class to be a utility class, remember to add a private constructor to prevent instantiation. (Note, that this use was known before PMD 5.1.0 as UseSingleton).</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts reusability, since making the class a utility would ease its access and usage.</p>
<h4>MS: Field should be both final and package protected  (MS_FINAL_PKGPROTECT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A mutable static field could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. The field could be made package protected and/or made final to avoid this vulnerability.</p>
<h4>Simplify Boolean Returns (SimplifyBooleanReturns)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Avoid unnecessary if-then-else statements when returning a boolean. The result of the conditional test can be returned instead.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts analysability, since unnecessary code confuses the reader.</p>
<h4>No: Using notify() rather than notifyAll() (NO_NOTIFY_NOT_NOTIFYALL)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method calls <code>notify()</code> rather than <code>notifyAll()</code>. Java monitors are often used for multiple conditions. Calling <code>notify()</code> only wakes up one thread, meaning that the thread woken up might not be the one waiting for the condition that the caller just satisfied.</p>
<h4>Missing Static Method In Non Instantiatable Class (MissingStaticMethodInNonInstantiatableClass)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: EFF ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">A class that has private constructors and does not have any static methods or fields cannot be used.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts analysability, since an unusable class represents unnecessary code. It also impact resources for the memory unnecessarily used.</p>
<h4>SA: Self assignment of local rather than assignment to field  (SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT_INSTEAD_OF_FIELD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method contains a self assignment of a local variable, and there is a field with an identical name. assignment appears to have been ; e.g. <pre>public void setFoo(int foo) { foo = foo; }</pre>. The assignment is useless. Did you mean to assign to the field instead?</p>
<h4>STI: Unneeded use of currentThread() call, to call interrupted()  (STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_CURRENTTHREAD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method invokes the <code>Thread.currentThread()</code> call, just to call the <code>interrupted()</code> method. As <code>interrupted()</code> is a static method, it is more simple and clear to use <code>Thread.interrupted()</code>. </p>
<h4>REC: Exception is caught when Exception is not thrown  (REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method uses a try-catch block that catches Exception objects, but Exception is not thrown within the try block, and RuntimeException is not explicitly caught.  It is a common bug pattern to say try { ... } catch (Exception e) { something } as a shorthand for catching a number of types of exception each of whose catch blocks is identical, but this construct also accidentally catches RuntimeException as well, masking potential bugs. </p>
<p class="desc">A better approach is to either explicitly catch the specific exceptions that are thrown, or to explicitly catch RuntimeException exception, rethrow it, and then catch all non-Runtime Exceptions, as shown below: <pre> try { ... } catch (RuntimeException e) { throw e; } catch (Exception e) { ... deal with all non-runtime exceptions ... }</pre></p>
<h4>DP: Method invoked that should be only be invoked inside a doPrivileged block  (DP_DO_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: SEC</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 4</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This code invokes a method that requires a security permission check. If this code will be granted security permissions, but might be invoked by code that does not have security permissions, then the invocation needs to occur inside a doPrivileged block.</p>
<h4>DL: Synchronization on boxed primitive values  (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_UNSHARED_BOXED_PRIMITIVE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The code synchronizes on an apparently unshared boxed primitive, such as an Integer.</p>
<p class="desc"><pre>private static final Integer fileLock = new Integer(1); ... synchronized(fileLock) { .. do something .. } ... </pre></p>
<p class="desc">It would be much better, in this code, to redeclare fileLock as <code>private static final Object fileLock = new Object();</code>. The existing code might be OK, but it is confusing and a future refactoring, such as the "Remove Boxing" refactoring in IntelliJ, might replace this with the use of an interned Integer object shared throughout the JVM, leading to very confusing behavior and potential deadlock.</p>
<h4>UW: Unconditional wait  (UW_UNCOND_WAIT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method contains a call to <code>java.lang.Object.wait()</code> which is not guarded by conditional control flow. The code should verify that condition it intends to wait for is not already satisfied before calling wait; any previous notifications will be ignored. </p>
<h4>NP: Load of known null value  (NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The variable referenced at this point is known to be null due to an earlier check against null. Although this is valid, it might be a mistake (perhaps you intended to refer to a different variable, or perhaps the earlier check to see if the variable is null should have been a check to see if it was nonnull). </p>
<h4>Se: Serializable inner class  (SE_INNER_CLASS)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: EFF</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 4</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This Serializable class is an inner class.  Any attempt to serialize it will also serialize the associated outer instance. The outer instance is serializable, so this won't fail, but it might serialize a lot more data than intended. If possible, making the inner class a static inner class (also known as a nested class) should solve the problem.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts efficiency, since a lot more data may be serialised than needed. It may produce false positive since we don't know how much data is really needed in the serialisation.</p>
<h4>RC: Suspicious reference comparison  (RC_REF_COMPARISON)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method compares two reference values using the == or != operator, where the correct way to compare instances of this type is generally with the equals() method. It is possible to create distinct instances that are equal but do not compare as == since they are different objects. Examples of classes which should generally not be compared by reference are java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Float, etc.</p>
<h4>UuF: Unused public or protected field  (UUF_UNUSED_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This field is never used. The field is public or protected, so perhaps it is intended to be used with classes not seen as part of the analysis. If not, consider removing it from the class.</p>
<h4>SIC: Should be a static inner class  (SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference to the object which created it. This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary. If possible, the class should be made static. </p>
<h4>JCIP: Fields of immutable classes should be final  (JCIP_FIELD_ISNT_FINAL_IN_IMMUTABLE_CLASS)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The class is annotated with net.jcip.annotations.Immutable or javax.annotation.concurrent.Immutable, and the rules for those annotations require that all fields are final.</p>
<h4>DL: Synchronization on boxed primitive  (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOXED_PRIMITIVE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Integer.</p> <pre> private static Integer count = 0; ... synchronized(count) { count++; } ... </pre> Since Integer objects can be cached and shared, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock.</p>
<p class="desc">See CERT <a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/CON08-J.+Do+not+synchronize+on+objects+that+may+be+reused">CON08-J. Do not synchronize on objects that may be reused</a> for more information.</p>
<h4>IL: An apparent infinite recursive loop  (IL_INFINITE_RECURSIVE_LOOP)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method unconditionally invokes itself. This would seem to indicate an infinite recursive loop that will result in a stack overflow.</p>
<h4>UR: Uninitialized read of field in constructor  (UR_UNINIT_READ)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This constructor reads a field which has not yet been assigned a value. This is often caused when the programmer mistakenly uses the field instead of one of the constructor's parameters.</p>
<h4>EC: Invocation of equals() on an array, which is equivalent to == (EC_BAD_ARRAY_COMPARE)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method invokes the .equals(Object o) method on an array. Since arrays do not override the equals method of Object, calling equals on an array is the same as comparing their addresses. To compare the contents of the arrays, use <code>java.util.Arrays.equals(Object[], Object[])</code>. To compare the addresses of the arrays, it would be less confusing to explicitly check pointer equality using <code>==</code>. </p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts analysability, since it is easier to read and understand the pointer equality for the intended behaviour.</p>
<h4>LI: Incorrect lazy initialization of static field  (LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a non-volatile static field. Because the compiler or processor may reorder instructions, threads are not guaranteed to see a completely initialized object, <em>if the method can be called by multiple threads</em>. You can make the field volatile to correct the problem. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/">Java Memory Model web site</a>. </p>
<h4>Unconditional If Statement (UnconditionalIfStatement)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Avoid returning from a finally block, this can discard exceptions.</p>
<p class="desc">A maintainer will have trouble understanding why an unconditional if has been used. It further clutters the code.</p>
<h4>FS: Format string references missing argument  (VA_FORMAT_STRING_MISSING_ARGUMENT)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REL</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 1</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Not enough arguments are passed to satisfy a placeholder in the format string. A runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed. </p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts reliability, since the pattern will throw an exception when executed.</p>
<h4>Eq: equals method overrides equals in superclass and may not be symmetric  (EQ_OVERRIDING_EQUALS_NOT_SYMMETRIC)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR REU</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This class defines an equals method that overrides an equals method in a superclass. Both equals methods use <code>instanceof</code> in the determination of whether two objects are equal. This is fraught with peril, since it is important that the equals method is symmetrical (in other words, <code>a.equals(b) == b.equals(a)</code>). If B is a subtype of A, and A's equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof A, and B's equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof B, it is quite likely that the equivalence relation defined by these methods is not symmetric. </p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since the result is not what was intended. It also impacts reusability, since other developers will assume the method is symmetric.</p>
<h4>Empty Switch Statements (EmptySwitchStatements)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Empty switch statements serve no purpose and should be removed.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.</p>
<h4>Empty Finally Block (EmptyFinallyBlock)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Empty finally blocks serve no purpose and should be removed.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts analysability, since it implies unnecessary code.</p>
<h4>DL: Synchronization on Boolean  (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOOLEAN)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Boolean.</p> <pre> private static Boolean inited = Boolean.FALSE; ... synchronized(inited) { if (!inited) { init(); inited = Boolean.TRUE; } } ... </pre> Since there normally exist only two Boolean objects, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock.</p>
<p class="desc">See CERT <a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/CON08-J.+Do+not+synchronize+on+objects+that+may+be+reused">CON08-J. Do not synchronize on objects that may be reused</a> for more information.</p>
<h4>Use Collection isEmpty (UseCollectionIsEmpty)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: ANA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The isEmpty() method on java.util.Collection is provided to determine if a collection has any elements. Comparing the value of size() to 0 does not convey intent as well as the isEmpty() method.</p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts analysability, since the intent is much clearer for the maintainer.</p>
<h4>FI: Explicit invocation of finalizer  (FI_EXPLICIT_INVOCATION)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method contains an explicit invocation of the <code>finalize()</code> method on an object. Because finalizer methods are supposed to be executed once, and only by the VM, this is a bad idea.</p>
<p class="desc">If a connected set of objects beings finalizable, then the VM will invoke the finalize method on all the finalizable object, possibly at the same time in different threads. Thus, it is a particularly bad idea, in the finalize method for a class X, invoke finalize on objects referenced by X, because they may already be getting finalized in a separate thread. </p>
<h4>RV: Negating the result of compareTo()/compare() (RV_NEGATING_RESULT_OF_COMPARETO)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This code negatives the return value of a compareTo or compare method. This is a questionable or bad programming practice, since if the return value is Integer.MIN_VALUE, negating the return value won't negate the sign of the result. You can achieve the same intended result by reversing the order of the operands rather than by negating the results. </p>
<p class="desc">This rule impacts correctness, since it may produce unpredictable behavirour in some cases.</p>
<h4>UuF: Unused field (UUF_UNUSED_FIELD)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: </p>
<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This field is never used. Consider removing it from the class.</p>
<h4>LawOfDemeter (LawOfDemeter)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: REU</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>

<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Using <code>new Double(double)</code> is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas <code>Double.valueOf(double)</code> allows caching of values to be done by the compiler, class library, or JVM. Using of cached values avoids object allocation and the code will be faster. </p>
<p class="desc">Values between -128 and 127 are guaranteed to have corresponding cached instances and using <code>valueOf</code> is approximately 3.5 times faster than using constructor. For values outside the constant range the performance of both styles is the same.</p>

This rule can be used to ensure that all classes within the org.sample package and its sub-packages are not used outside of the org.sample package hierarchy. Further, the only allowed usage outside of a class in the org.sample hierarchy would be via org.sample.SampleInterface.</p>

<h4>GC: No relationship between generic parameter and method argument  (GC_UNRELATED_TYPES)</h4>
<p class="desc">Category: COR CHA</p>
<p class="desc">Priority: 3</p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This call to a generic collection method contains an argument with an incompatible class from that of the collection's parameter (i.e., the type of the argument is neither a supertype nor a subtype of the corresponding generic type argument). Therefore, it is unlikely that the collection contains any objects that are equal to the method argument used here. Most likely, the wrong value is being passed to the method.</p>
<p class="desc">In general, instances of two unrelated classes are not equal. For example, if the Foo and Bar classes are not related by subtyping, then an instance of Foo should not be equal to an instance of Bar. Among other issues, doing so will likely result in an equals method that is not symmetrical. For example, if you define the Foo class so that a Foo can be equal to a String, your equals method isn't symmetrical since a String can only be equal to a String.</p>
<p class="desc">In rare cases, people do define nonsymmetrical equals methods and still manage to make their code work. Although none of the APIs document or guarantee it, it is typically the case that if you check if a Collection<String> contains a Foo, the equals method of argument (e.g., the equals method of the Foo class) used to perform the equality checks.</p>

<h4>SWL: Method calls Thread.sleep() with a lock held (SWL_SLEEP_WITH_LOCK_HELD)</h4>

In Java 5 the PriorityQueue.remove method uses the compareTo method, while in Java 6 it uses the equals method.</p>
<p class="desc">From the JavaDoc for the compareTo method in the Comparable interface: <blockquote> It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that <code>(x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y))</code>.

It may leave the sub-class unable to construct its superclass or forced to replicate the construction process completely within itself, losing the ability to call super(). If the default constructor contains a call to an overridable method, the subclass may be completely uninstantiable.

With the creation of the peer, the system creates the event dispatch thread. This makes things problematic because the event dispatch thread could be notifying listeners while pack and validate are still processing. This situation could result in two threads going through the Swing component-based GUI -- it's a serious flaw that could result in deadlocks or other related threading issues. A pack call causes components to be realized. As they are being realized (that is, not necessarily visible), they could trigger listener notification on the event dispatch thread.</p>

<p class="desc">This method ignores the return value of one of the variants of <code>java.io.InputStream.read()</code> which can return multiple bytes. If the return value is not checked, the caller will not be able to correctly handle the case where fewer bytes were read than the caller requested. This is a particularly insidious kind of bug, because in many programs, reads from input streams usually do read the full amount of data requested, causing the program to fail only sporadically.</p>

<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a static field. After the field is set, the object stored into that location is further updated or accessed. The setting of the field is visible to other threads as soon as it is set. If the futher accesses in the method that set the field serve to initialize the object, then you have a <em>very serious</em> multithreading bug, unless something else prevents any other thread from accessing the stored object until it is fully initialized. </p>
<p class="desc">Even if you feel confident that the method is never called by multiple threads, it might be better to not set the static field until the value you are setting it to is fully populated/initialized.</p>

<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The return value of this method should be checked. One common cause of this warning is to invoke a method on an immutable object, thinking that it updates the object. For example, in the following code fragment, <code>String dateString = getHeaderField(name); dateString.trim();</code> the programmer seems to be thinking that the trim() method will update the String referenced by dateString. But since Strings are immutable, the trim() function returns a new String value, which is being ignored here. The code should be corrected to: <code>String dateString = getHeaderField(name); dateString = dateString.trim();</code>.</p>

<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">Instantiation by way of private constructors from outside of the constructor's class often causes the generation of an accessor. A factory method, or non-privatization of the constructor can eliminate this situation. The generated class file is actually an interface. It gives the accessing class the ability to invoke a new hidden package scope constructor that takes the interface as a supplementary parameter. This turns a private constructor effectively into one with package scope, and is challenging to discern.</p>

This is because 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a double (or as a binary fraction of any finite length). Thus, the long value that is being passed in to the constructor is not exactly equal to 0.1, appearances notwithstanding. The (String) constructor, on the other hand, is perfectly predictable: 'new BigDecimal('0.1')' is exactly equal to 0.1, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally recommended that the (String) constructor be used in preference to this one.</p>

<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">The method seems to be building a String using concatenation in a loop. In each iteration, the String is converted to a StringBuffer/StringBuilder, appended to, and converted back to a String. This can lead to a cost quadratic in the number of iterations, as the growing string is recopied in each iteration.</p>
<p class="desc">Better performance can be obtained by using a StringBuffer (or StringBuilder in Java 1.5) explicitly. For example: <pre>/* This is bad */ String s = ""; for (int i = 0; i &lt; field.length; ++i) { s = s + field[i]; }</pre> <pre>/* This is better */ StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; field.length; ++i) { buf.append(field[i]); } String s = buf.toString();</pre>.</p>

<p class="desc">Priority: </p>
<p class="desc">Description:</p>
<p class="desc">OpenJDK introduces a potential incompatibility. In particular, the java.util.logging.Logger behavior has changed. Instead of using strong references, it now uses weak references internally. That's a reasonable change, but unfortunately some code relies on the old behavior - when changing logger configuration, it simply drops the logger reference. That means that the garbage collector is free to reclaim that memory, which means that the logger configuration is lost.</p>
<p class="desc">For example, consider: <pre>public static void initLogging() throws Exception { Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("edu.umd.cs"); logger.addHandler(new FileHandler()); /* call to change logger configuration */ logger.setUseParentHandlers(false); /* another call to change logger configuration */ }</pre>. The logger reference is lost at the end of the method (it doesn't escape the method), so if you have a garbage collection cycle just after the call to initLogging, the logger configuration is lost (because Logger only keeps weak references). <pre>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { initLogging(); /* adds a file handler to the logger */ System.gc(); /* logger configuration lost */ Logger.getLogger("edu.umd.cs").info("Some message"); /* this isn't logged to the file as expected */}</pre> --- <em>Ulf Ochsenfahrt and Eric Fellheimer</em>.</p>
